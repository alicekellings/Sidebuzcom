Kick streamer Adin Ross (787K followers) has once again found himself at the center of attention after receiving a verbal warning from Kick CEO Edward â€œEddieâ€?Craven. This incident occurred in his in-real-life (IRL) stream (November 6) when he was seen driving and texting while being escorted by police cars.

Besides being a dangerous act in itself, texting or using phones while driving is also punishable on some other streaming sites like Twitch. This was echoed by the Kick CEO, who, according to one of Adinâ€™s friends, said:

> â€œYouâ€™re in troubleâ€?for) using your phone while driving. Yeah, Eddie called me.â€?

## â€œWhat was the actual problem?â€?â€?Adin Ross surprised after Kick CEO sends warning

Adin Ross has a history of engaging in controversial actions during his live broadcasts, which has consistently garnered criticism. This latest incident is no exception, as it was reported that the streamer was caught using his phone while driving during his recent IRL stream.

The streamer and co-owner of Kick was seen escorted out by a couple of police vehicles during his stream. However, he also streamed himself using his phone while driving.

Eddie, who likely witnessed this behavior, promptly contacted one of his friends to emphasize the importance of refraining from such actions, especially in the presence of law enforcement. In response to the warning, Adin expressed:

> â€œFor real? What was the actual problem?â€?
His friend chimed in:

> â€œDonâ€™t use your phone while driving.â€?
Adin continued:

> â€œF**k. Is that illegal?â€?
Another co-passenger weighed in:

> â€œTo be fair, we canâ€™t be streaming now that we have got police escort and using your phoneâ€¦â€?
Before this particular incident,Â Adin Rossâ€?mother had to address his behaviorÂ when she noticed that he was excessively speeding.

Adin Ross isnâ€™t the only streamer who faced consequences for their reckless driving behavior. In August 2023,Â Yousef â€œFouseyâ€?was banned from TwitchÂ after he attempted to drive recklessly, played loud music in the car, and simultaneously streamed his actions.

Fousey, who is also a streamer on Kick, was admitted to a mental hospital for more than two months following a recent outburst in front of the police during one of his streams. He has since announced that he plans to resume streaming sometime this month.
