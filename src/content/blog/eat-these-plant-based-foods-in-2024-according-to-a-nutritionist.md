## A Plant-Forward Future

At the end of December, we shared our 2024Â wellness forecast. And if one thingâ€™s for certain, itâ€™s this: trending food predictions are plant-forward. In fact, theÂ Mediterranean dietÂ holds theÂ *No. 1 Best Diet Overallâ€?a lifestyle that champions fruits, veggies,Â whole grains, beans, nuts, legumes, herbs, and spices.Â (Ahem, plants!) Sustainable, plant-based cooking is the future. Speaking of, asÂ longevity goalsÂ increase, produce-forward diets will follow suit. This shift is twofold. It recognizes the importance of ethical food choicesÂ *andÂ *the nutritional density of plants. A compassionate approach to nourishment is here to stay.


## Is veganism worth the hype?

IYKYKâ€”the landscape of nutrition isÂ *vast*. Unfortunately, itâ€™s filled withÂ misinformationÂ and inaccurate health claims. So if youâ€™re confused about what to put on your plate, youâ€™re not alone. Ultimately, the goal is to take theÂ stressÂ out of eating. Food is joy, after all!

The aim is to cultivate a feel-good,Â gut-friendly, and balanced approach to food. For some, that means prioritizing a vegan diet. With itsÂ health benefitsÂ and positive impact on the environment, veganism is soaring. And while this lifestyle isnâ€™t for everyone, thereâ€™s no doubt that plants are paramount.


## Can you get all the nutrients you need on a plant-based diet?

Yes! Adopting a plant-based or vegan dietÂ *can*Â provide all the essential nutrients required for optimal health. That said, it often necessitates careful planning and a mindful approach. Plant-based dietsâ€?rich inÂ colorful produce, nuts, legumes, etc.â€”provide everything from ampleÂ proteinÂ to energizing carbs and immune-supportingÂ antioxidants. However, certain nutrients (those abundantly found in animal products), may require special attention. Think:Â vitamin B12. Fortunately, thatâ€™s where fortified foods andÂ supplementsÂ shine. With intentionality in mind, a diverse, plant-based diet can easily provide all necessary nutrients.

*Consider consulting with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to design a balanced, plant-based diet to meet your nutritional requirements.*


## More Protein, Less Meat

Across the board, weâ€™re becoming savvier grocery shoppersâ€”particularly when it comes to protein.Â *Hooray!Â *Weâ€™re inching further away from the disguises of aÂ faux burgerÂ (with a laundry list of ingredients) and moving toward simple, non-meat protein sources. And thisÂ Whole Food Marketsâ€?2024 Trend ReportÂ proves it. As the year unfolds, weâ€™ll be stocking up on protein sources made from whole foods (edamame, beans, walnuts, mushrooms, seeds, buckwheat, sprouted grains, etc.) to meet ourÂ muscle-building goals. Sayonara, complex meat alternatives.


## Vegan Seafood is Making Waves

Carrots as lox? Trumpet mushrooms as scallops? Root veggies (konjac) in sushi rolls and poke bowls? You betcha. What started as a subtle dip in the plant-based seafood pond is becoming a head-first submergence. In response to theÂ tinned fish trend, vegan food brands are making their own versions of salty, seafood-esque snacks. Weâ€™re jazzed aboutÂ Mind Blownâ€™sÂ new sea scallops,Â Seed to Surfâ€™sÂ tinned snow crab, andÂ KonsciousÂ sushi rolls. And if youâ€™re ready for watermelon nigiri, book a table at everyoneâ€™s favorite plant-based restaurant,Â Planta.


## Fuel Your Gut with Plants

Weâ€™ve only explored the tip of theÂ gut healthÂ iceberg, but thereâ€™s no denying its influence. And itâ€™s no secret that aÂ diverseÂ gut microbiome has benefits beyond digestive health. Think: cognitive function,Â hormones, mood, sleep quality, and more. With digestion a priority, pre- and probiotics will be rising stars in 2024. And where can you get them? Plants. From kimchi and sauerkraut to tempeh, miso, and pickled veggies, probiotics are a dime a dozen. Fiber-rich prebiotics (food for probiotics) are even more accessibleâ€”bananas, blueberries, spinach, onions, artichokes, and oatmeal. Plant-based eating does the gut good.


## Quiet Luxury: Food Edition

The â€œquiet luxuryâ€?trend has its hands in the fashion industry, but itâ€™s only a matter of time before the food world gets a bite. What will this look like? Consumers will splurge on the little things: high-quality olives, locally made vegan cheeses, and unique items to help elevate the everydayâ€”likeÂ chili-forward spices. Below are elevated plant-based foods you donâ€™t want to miss in 2024.

### Climax Foods Cheese

Vegan brie, feta, chÃ¨vre, and blue cheeses, anyone? If youâ€™re new toÂ Climax Foods, thank us later. This brand is using science to mimic animal-based ingredients like casein (which gives cheese its stretchiness). You can already find these cheeses at several restaurantsâ€”including three Michelinâ€“starÂ Atelier Crennâ€”but youâ€™ll soon be able to shop them at specialty retailers.

### Seeductive Foods Cheese

More plant-based cheese, please.Â Seeductive Foodsâ€™Â hemp- and pumpkin seedâ€“based cheeses are packed with heart-healthy omega-3s and vegan protein. Plus, theyâ€™re fermented to give them a gut-healthy tang. Uplevel yourÂ charcuterie boardÂ with aÂ bundleÂ of non-dairy cheese.

### Mellody Vegan Honey

As sweet and thick as the real stuff,Â Mellodyâ€™s vegan honeyÂ is the worldâ€™s first plant-based honey. And trust us, it doesnâ€™t disappoint. From cooking to baking toÂ mocktail-ing, this sweetener is worth the hype.

### Outstanding Stuffins

Crunchy snacks are pantry staples. The newest to our shelves?Â Outstanding Stuffins. Available in three flavorsâ€”Chedda, Nacho Cheese, and Pizza Partayâ€”all of them are deliciously dairy-free. Kiss the munchies goodbye with these crowd-pleasing bites.

### Sâ€™NOODS Spicy Miso Ramen

Another snack we canâ€™t stop raving about?Â Sâ€™NOODSÂ spicy miso ramen. This vegan, gluten-free, and flavor-packed snack is great for grabbing on the go. If youâ€™re craving instant ramen, this will (totally) satisfy.

### Shroomeats

Move over, faux meat patties.Â ShroomeatsÂ mushroom-based meats are packed with flavor and texture and have only six simple ingredients. Serve â€™em up with your favorite burger buns and condiments.

### Zeroe Vegan Caviar

The piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance of silent luxury? Caviar. If you didnâ€™t think plant-based caviar existed, think again.Â ZeroeÂ makes a vegan version from responsibly sourced seaweedâ€”and itâ€™s pure culinary bliss.


## Welcoming a New Kind of Plant-Based Lifestyle

As we step into 2024, the era ofÂ plant-based foodsÂ is looking more promising than ever. Sustainable (and delicious!) meat alternatives are at our fingertips. Best of all, theyâ€™re appealing to a broader audience of eaters: those seeking healthier, environmentally conscious choices. From simple dairy substitutes to flavorful plant-based snacks, the year ahead promises a culinary adventure. Together, letâ€™s make plants a priority.
