Let me paint you a picture.

September 2024. I'm three weeks into college. My bank account has $127. Textbooks just cost me $340 I didn't have. And my meal plan is about to run out.

My options were: get a campus job (already missed the hiring window), ask my parents for money (absolutely not), or figure something else out.

I chose "figure something else out."

## The Stuff That Didn't Work

**Dropshipping**: Watched 30 YouTube videos. Spent $150 on ads. Made zero sales.

**Survey sites**: Six hours. Made $11.23. Never again.

**Selling stuff on campus**: Ran out of stuff after two weeks.

## The Turning Point

An upperclassman was making $400/month tutoring online, 8 hours/week. That's when it clicked: **the best side hustle is whatever matches YOUR situation.**

## What I Wish I'd Known

1. Know your actual constraints
2. Your major matters more than you think  
3. Some side hustles need money to start
4. The "perfect" option depends on your personality

## Finding What Fits

For me: freelance writing. First month: $180. By month three: $500/month.
