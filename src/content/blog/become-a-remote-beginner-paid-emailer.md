Have you ever written short email messages before? We need to talk if you have that skill set.

We are currently looking for new beginner-paid remote workers who want to start work right away!

All employers hiring through our company are looking for people with no previous experience but are willing to learn. These are remote positions, meaning that as long as you can work the required hours, you can work from home.



In this position, you will be assigned tasks related to sending promotional email messages about various products and services. You must write in clear English with no errors and provide consistency so we can rely on you to produce many weekly messages.

The rate we offer varies depending on what kind of assignment(s) you'll take. Still, generally speaking, it ranges between $40-$80 per hour depending on what service(s) they entail and your level of expertise.



Best of luck!
