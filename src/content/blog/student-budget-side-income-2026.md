# How Much Can You Really Make as a Student?

Everyone online is making $10K/month apparently.

YouTube gurus. Instagram influencers. TikTok entrepreneurs.

Meanwhile, I was making $200/month and thought I was doing something wrong.

Turns out, I wasn't. Those numbers are BS.

Here's what students ACTUALLY make from side hustles. Real numbers. Real time investment. No BS.

## My First Three Months (The Reality)

**Month 1**: $180
**Month 2**: $420
**Month 3**: $680

Not $10K. Not even $1K at first.

But you know what? $680/month covered my groceries, gas, and going out money.

That's what actually matters.

## The Income Tiers (What's Actually Possible)

After talking to 30+ students with side hustles, I found five income tiers.

### Tier 1: The "Beer Money" Level ($100-300/Month)

**Time investment**: 5-8 hours/month
**Effort level**: Low
**Examples**: Surveys, cashback apps, selling old stuff

**Reality**: This isn't real income. It's pocket change.

My roommate makes $150/month from:
- Rakuten cashback: $30
- Selling textbooks: $80
- Random surveys: $40

Takes him maybe 6 hours total per month.

**Good for**: Extra spending money, not bills

### Tier 2: The "Grocery Money" Level ($300-600/Month)

**Time investment**: 10-15 hours/month
**Effort level**: Medium
**Examples**: Tutoring, gig apps, plasma donation

**Reality**: This is where most students actually land.

I made $420 my second month from:
- Tutoring (8 hours): $200
- DoorDash (10 hours): $180
- Plasma donation (3 hours): $40

**Good for**: Groceries, gas, small bills

### Tier 3: The "Rent Money" Level ($600-1,200/Month)

**Time investment**: 15-25 hours/month
**Effort level**: Medium-High
**Examples**: Freelancing, multiple tutoring clients, consistent gig work

**Reality**: This takes real effort but is totally doable.

I'm here now. Make $800-1,000/month from:
- Tutoring 4 students (16 hours): $400
- Freelance writing (12 hours): $400-600

**Good for**: Rent, groceries, most living expenses

### Tier 4: The "Full Living Expenses" Level ($1,200-2,000/Month)

**Time investment**: 25-35 hours/month
**Effort level**: High
**Examples**: Established freelancing, multiple income streams, specialized skills

**Reality**: This is like having a part-time job, but on your terms.

My friend Sarah makes $1,400/month from:
- VA work for 3 clients (20 hours): $800
- Social media management (10 hours): $400
- Tutoring (8 hours): $200

**Good for**: All living expenses, building savings

### Tier 5: The "Unicorn" Level ($2,000+/Month)

**Time investment**: 35+ hours/month (basically full-time)
**Effort level**: Very High
**Examples**: Successful freelancing, established business, specialized high-pay work

**Reality**: Rare for full-time students. Usually requires sacrificing social life or grades.

I know ONE student making $2,500/month. He's:
- Taking 12 credits (not 15)
- Working 40+ hours/week on his business
- Sleeping 5-6 hours/night
- Has no social life

**Good for**: People willing to sacrifice everything else

## The Time vs Money Reality

Here's what nobody tells you: there's a ceiling.

You can't make $5K/month as a full-time student. There aren't enough hours.

**The math**:
- 15 credits = ~45 hours/week (classes + studying)
- Sleep = 49 hours/week (7 hours/night)
- Basic life stuff = 21 hours/week (eating, hygiene, etc.)

**Total**: 115 hours/week used

**Remaining**: 53 hours/week

**Realistically available for work**: 20-30 hours/week (need some downtime)

At $30/hour (good rate), that's $600-900/week or $2,400-3,600/month.

But that's working EVERY available hour. No social life. No breaks. No buffer for exams.

**Realistic sustainable income**: $800-1,500/month

## My Actual Budget Breakdown

Let me show you my real numbers.

**Monthly expenses**:
- Rent: $650 (split with roommate)
- Groceries: $200
- Gas: $80
- Phone: $40
- Going out: $100
- Misc: $50

**Total**: $1,120/month

**Income**:
- Tutoring: $400
- Freelance writing: $400-600
- Occasional gig work: $100-200

**Total**: $900-1,200/month

Some months I'm short $100-200. Parents help with that.

Some months I'm up $50-100. That goes to savings.

**Reality**: I'm not getting rich. But I'm covering most of my expenses.

## The Progression Timeline

Here's what realistic growth looks like:

**Month 1**: $100-300 (testing, learning, failing)
**Month 2**: $300-500 (found what works)
**Month 3**: $400-700 (getting consistent)
**Month 4-6**: $600-1,000 (established clients/routine)
**Month 7-12**: $800-1,500 (optimized, raised rates)

**Year 2**: $1,000-2,000 (if you keep at it)

Not linear. Some months are $600. Some are $1,200.

But the trend goes up if you stick with it.

## What Different Majors Actually Make

Based on students I know:

**CS/Engineering majors**: $800-1,500/month
- Tutoring: $30-40/hour
- Freelance coding: $40-80/hour
- Tech support: $25-35/hour

**Business majors**: $600-1,200/month
- Social media management: $300-600/month per client
- VA work: $400-800/month
- Tutoring: $20-30/hour

**Liberal arts majors**: $500-1,000/month
- Writing: $100-500/article
- Tutoring: $20-30/hour
- Gig work: $15-25/hour

**Pre-med/Science majors**: $600-1,200/month
- Tutoring (high demand): $30-50/hour
- Research assistant: $15-20/hour
- Plasma donation: $200-400/month

**Undecided/General**: $400-800/month
- Gig apps: $15-25/hour
- Campus jobs: $12-18/hour
- Odd jobs: $20-30/hour

## The Hidden Costs Nobody Mentions

Making money costs money. Here's what I spend:

**Monthly costs**:
- Gas for gig work: $40
- Grammarly Premium (writing): $12
- Notion (organization): $10
- Phone data (need it for gigs): $10

**Total**: $72/month

**Annual costs**:
- Taxes on self-employment income: ~$600/year ($50/month)
- Car maintenance (extra wear): ~$300/year ($25/month)

**Real monthly cost**: $147

So if I make $1,000/month, my actual take-home is $853.

**Nobody talks about this.**

## The Opportunity Cost

Here's the real question: is it worth it?

**Option A: Side Hustle**
- Make $1,000/month
- Work 20 hours/month
- Flexible schedule
- Build skills

**Option B: Campus Job**
- Make $960/month (20 hours × $12/hour)
- Fixed schedule
- Less flexibility
- Basic job experience

**Option C: Focus on School**
- Make $0/month
- Better grades
- More internship opportunities
- Higher starting salary after graduation

I chose Option A. But Option C might be smarter long-term.

A 0.5 GPA increase could mean $5K-10K higher starting salary. That's worth way more than $1,000/month for 2 years.

**Be honest about your priorities.**

## Five Students, Five Income Levels

**Alex** (CS major, 3.8 GPA):
- Income: $1,200/month
- Hours: 20/month
- Method: Freelance coding
- Sacrifice: Social life

**Maria** (Business major, 3.4 GPA):
- Income: $800/month
- Hours: 18/month
- Method: VA work + tutoring
- Sacrifice: Sleep

**Chris** (English major, 3.6 GPA):
- Income: $600/month
- Hours: 20/month
- Method: Writing + gig apps
- Sacrifice: Weekends

**Jordan** (Pre-med, 3.9 GPA):
- Income: $400/month
- Hours: 12/month
- Method: Tutoring only
- Sacrifice: Minimal (prioritizes grades)

**Sam** (Undecided, 2.8 GPA):
- Income: $1,400/month
- Hours: 35/month
- Method: Multiple gigs
- Sacrifice: Grades

**Notice the pattern**: Higher income usually means lower GPA or more sacrifice.

## The Realistic Monthly Targets

Based on your situation:

**If you have 5-10 hours/month**: Target $200-400
**If you have 10-15 hours/month**: Target $400-700
**If you have 15-20 hours/month**: Target $700-1,200
**If you have 20-30 hours/month**: Target $1,000-1,800
**If you have 30+ hours/month**: Consider if school is the priority

## What I'd Tell My Past Self

Stop comparing yourself to YouTube gurus.

They're either:
1. Lying
2. Working 80 hours/week
3. Not actually students
4. Making money from selling courses, not the method

**Realistic student income**: $500-1,500/month

That's enough to:
- Cover most expenses
- Build small savings
- Have some fun money
- Not stress constantly

That's success.

## The Three-Month Test

Give yourself three months.

**Month 1**: Test different options. Make $100-300.
**Month 2**: Focus on what worked. Make $300-600.
**Month 3**: Optimize and scale. Make $500-900.

If you're not at $500/month by month 3, either:
- Try a different method
- Increase your hours
- Accept that school is the priority right now

All three are valid choices.

## The Semester Reality

Income fluctuates by semester.

**Start of semester**: Lower income (adjusting to classes)
**Mid-semester**: Peak income (in rhythm)
**Midterms**: Income drops (need study time)
**End of semester**: Income drops (finals)
**Breaks**: Potential for higher income (more time)

**My actual numbers**:
- September: $680
- October: $920
- November: $1,100
- December: $400 (finals)
- January: $1,200 (winter break)

**Average**: $860/month

Plan for the fluctuation.

## Final Thoughts

You're not going to make $10K/month as a student.

You might make $500. You might make $1,500.

That's enough.

Enough to cover expenses. Enough to build savings. Enough to not stress about money constantly.

Stop chasing the YouTube numbers. Start with realistic goals.

$500/month is success. $1,000/month is great. $1,500/month is exceptional.

Pick your target. Build toward it. Be patient.

You'll get there.
