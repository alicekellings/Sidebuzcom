If youâ€™re looking to kickstart a high-incomeÂ side hustleÂ in 2024, youâ€™re not alone. Nearly two in five, or 39%, of U.S. adults have a side hustle to supplement their incomes â€?and pay essential bills, according to a recentÂ BankrateÂ survey.

But where to begin? You might want to consider a side hustle that aligns with your interests or talents. For example, this teacher translated herÂ passion for education into a lucrative online gig, and this 26-year-oldâ€™s ChatGPT obsession led to aÂ â€œsimple,â€?$4,000-a-month side hustle.

Of course, building aÂ successful side hustleÂ can be easier said than done. But millions of AmericansÂ areÂ *doing it â€?and can provide invaluable insights when it comes to navigating business ventures of your own.

*Entrepreneur*â€˜s Side Hustle Spotlight series shares some of their inspiring stories and helpful advice. Three of them â€?all of whom have made more than $20,000 per month at least once since launching theirÂ side hustlesÂ â€?spill their secrets to success below.

**Jeff Neal**

Record monthly earnings: $27,000

Neal runs a cricket-breeding side hustle,Â Critter Depot, out of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

â€œFirst, find a product and how to source it,â€?Neal says. â€œDonâ€™t spend time, money and energy on building out a website andÂ marketingÂ that website without first knowing which product you are going to sell and where you are going to get that product from. Also, take note of what skills you learn when you start a side hustle. Many side hustles flop, and thatâ€™s okay. You will learn many business skills trying aÂ side hustle, and those skills are transferable to your full-time job, which can help you advance in your career. So donâ€™t worry about a side hustle failing. There is much toÂ learn from failure.â€?

**Tara Laczynski**

Record monthly earnings: $22,735

Laczynski makes about $150,000 a year working 20 hours a week teaching onÂ Outschool, a live, online learning platform for kids.

â€œYou can find a way to turn your passion into a paycheck,â€?Laczynski says. â€œWhen you love what you do, itâ€™s contagious. Focus on doing things correctly,Â scalingÂ organically and staying consistent in your product. You must maintain your customer experience when you have one customer or one hundred. Creating sustainable systems, building your support, and keeping aÂ growth mindsetÂ are key. You should constantly grow and learn, so seek experts and be open to support.â€?

**Lilly Skjoldahl**

Skjoldahl turned her furniture-flipping side hustle intoÂ The Furniture Dr.

Record monthly earnings: $37,000

â€œBe consistent and authentic,â€?Skjoldahl says. â€œNetworkÂ with everyone you can â€?especially those outside your â€˜nicheâ€?or business industry. Iâ€™ve learned the most from others who are not in my industry and found unique ways to apply their advice to my own business and niche. Iâ€™ve also found that scrolling social media feeds does nothing but limit myÂ creativityÂ and inspiration. The less I scroll, the more creative I become and the better my content and business perform. Never rely on one stream of income. Find many ways to profit from whatever you are hustling, and repurpose everything. And most importantly,Â work smarter, not harder.
