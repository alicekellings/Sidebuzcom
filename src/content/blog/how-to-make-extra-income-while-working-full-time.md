Is your dwindling bank account impacting your health? TheÂ American Psychological AssociationÂ (APA) released a survey showing that money stress impacts Americansâ€?health nationwide. And, as it turns out, the wealthy are also stressed about money â€”Â not just those in lower-income households.

You can eliminate some of that financial stress by earning additional income, even if you have a full-time job. Steve Chou ofÂ MyWifeQuitHerJobÂ famously started two six-figure businesses while continuing to work at his day job.

Whether youâ€™re looking for cash to launch your startup or make new investments with, or dig out from mounting debt, a few hundred to a few thousand dollars a month can change your life.Â Here are some extra income ideas to get you started.

## Start a service business

Launching a service business can be done without a large network, an online presenceÂ or much overhead. The easiest way to start is by telling people in your existing network what youâ€™re offering and asking them to spread the word.

Noah Kagan from AppSumo nailed this concept. He decided to see if he could earn $1,000 in 24 hours, starting from scratch. He ended up founding aÂ successful beef jerky subscription businessÂ that he gave to one of his students to run.

You can look to his success story and steal his concept with a business like dinner catering, freelance writingÂ or online marketing. Start by crafting a killerÂ outreach emailÂ to get yourself up and running in just a few days.




## Invest in real estate

Becoming a landlord isnâ€™t always practical for those who are employed full-time and already strapped for cash. But you can look at buying a condo or small property in another country as a vacation getaway instead. The price tag is typically cheaper, even when you hireÂ a local property management group to manage renters while youâ€™re away.

Commercial real estate can be a great side hustle and lucrative way to invest and earn passive income, even without a large down payment. Get started with a site likeÂ Realty Mogul, and invest in commercial real estate for as little as $5,000. Youâ€™ll get vetted deals and access to high-end listings you wouldnâ€™t otherwise find.

## Launch an online resource

There are lots of different ways to make extra money online. Share your expertise by launching an online course or ebook to help others while you earn passive income. My own ebook,Â *100 Days of Growth,*Â ended upÂ generating more incomeÂ than my day job. It was a ton of up-front work, but once it was ready to go, it took minimal effort to maintain and to keep up with sales.

If writing ebooks isnâ€™t your strong suit, launch a video course or bootcamp instead. I didnâ€™t stop at books â€”Â I also launched aÂ content marketing bootcampÂ throughÂ ContentMarketer.ioÂ to help my clients masterÂ content-marketing abilities in 10 weeks.




## Leverage the power of Amazon

Itâ€™s always an admirable goal to launch your own online store and build a customer base, but youâ€™re also talking about wearing many different hats. Asides from using Amazonâ€™s affiliate marketing program to earn passive income, you need to research products, find a manufacturer, market your siteÂ and figure out how to fulfill orders. Donâ€™t forget about customer service and refund requests.

Instead, you could sell a product and develop a presence directly on AmazonÂ without the need to take on so many roles. Some sellers even have their products shipped directly to Amazonâ€™s fulfillment center and never touch the product itself.

## Join the sharing economy

Itâ€™s not hard to nail down a few hundred to thousands of dollars a month by leveraging the sharing economy. But itâ€™s not just about renting out your spare bedroom or basement on Airbnb. Rent out your car on Turo and bike to work or carpool instead. Rent out your camera equipment lying around your house on Cameralends, your snowboard or bike onÂ SpinlisterÂ or your sailboat onÂ Sailo.

And if you are going to rent on Airbnb, consider helping your revenue skyrocketÂ by renting out your entire house instead, and using the opportunity to visit family or go on vacation.

## Host an event

You can make good money hosting events without aiming for thousands of sign-ups, vendorsÂ and high-profile guest speakers. Instead, form a free MeetUp group on a topic youâ€™re knowledgeable about, like growth hacking, and run free events.

After you secure a loyal following,Â charge for an eventÂ with a reputable guest speaker. Rent out a small, upscale conference room at a nearby hotel, and grow your new MeetUp by hosting exclusive, sought-after events that charge a premium for fantastic content.

## Get paid to do what youâ€™re already doing

Take inventory of what youâ€™re doing in your spare time. People who love skydiving (like me!) can get certified to teach and do jumps on the weekend. You get to do what you love while earning extra money with an easy side hustle at the same time. Ask your local bar if you can help run its trivia night, or bartend a few nights a week while hanging out and getting to talk to interesting people.

Even if youâ€™re not interested in doing much but relaxing and surfing online, you can earn money by testing websites and recording your opinion with a site likeÂ UserTesting.

So, get out there. Use your imagination to start a flow of extra income today.
