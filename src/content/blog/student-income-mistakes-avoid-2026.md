# 7 Student Income Mistakes I Made So You Don't Have To

Let me tell you about the time I lost $500 trying to make money online.

Junior year. Saw a YouTube video about dropshipping. Guy was making $10K/month. Showed his Shopify dashboard. Drove a Tesla.

I thought: "I can do that."

Spoiler: I could not do that.

Spent $500 on inventory, ads, and a Shopify subscription. Made $80 in sales. Lost money on every single order after shipping and returns.

That was mistake #1. I made six more after that.

Here's what I learned the expensive way so you don't have to.

## Mistake #1: Chasing the "Big Money" Opportunities

The dropshipping disaster taught me something important.

The opportunities that promise the most money usually require the most money to start.

**What I thought**: "If I can make $10K/month, spending $500 to start is nothing!"

**Reality**: Most "big money" opportunities are:
- Expensive to test
- Require skills you don't have yet
- Take months to see results
- Have a high failure rate

**What I should have done**: Started with something that cost $0 and paid within a week.

Like freelance writing. Or virtual assistant work. Or literally anything that didn't require buying inventory.

**The fix**: If an opportunity requires more than $50 to start, skip it until you've made money from free opportunities first.

## Mistake #2: Trying to Do Everything at Once

After dropshipping failed, I overcorrected.

I signed up for:
- Upwork (freelancing)
- Fiverr (gig work)
- Rev (transcription)
- UserTesting (website testing)
- Respondent (research studies)
- Amazon Mechanical Turk (micro tasks)

All in the same week.

**What happened**: I spent so much time managing profiles and checking for work that I barely did any actual work.

Made $120 that month across all six platforms. Would've made more working at Starbucks.

**The lesson**: One platform. One income stream. Master it. Then add more.

**What worked instead**: I picked Upwork. Spent two weeks learning how to write good proposals. Landed three clients. Made $800 that month.

Focus beats hustle every time.

## Mistake #3: Underpricing My Work (By A Lot)

My first freelance writing gig: $15 for a 1000-word article.

Took me 4 hours to write. That's $3.75/hour.

I could've made more donating plasma.

**Why I did it**: Thought I needed to be "competitive" as a student with no experience.

**Reality**: Cheap clients are the worst clients. They demand more revisions. They're never satisfied. They don't respect your time.

**The turning point**: I raised my rates to $100 per article. Lost the cheap clients. Found better ones who actually valued my work.

**What I learned**: Your rates signal your value. Price like a professional, get treated like a professional.

If you're not sure what to charge for your skills, tools like our [quiz to find your side hustle](/tools/student-income-finder/) can show you market rates for different types of work.

## Mistake #4: Ignoring Taxes Until It Was Too Late

Made $3,200 my first year from freelancing. Spent it all.

Tax season came. Owed $800.

Didn't have it.

**What I didn't know**: Self-employment income is taxed differently. You pay both employee AND employer taxes. About 25-30% total.

**The panic**: Had to borrow money from my parents to pay the IRS. Embarrassing.

**What I do now**: Every time I get paid, I immediately move 30% to a separate savings account. Don't touch it until tax time.

**The rule**: If you make more than $400/year from side income, you need to report it and pay taxes. No exceptions.

## Mistake #5: Saying Yes to Every Opportunity

A client asked if I could design a logo.

I can't design. I've never designed anything. I use default PowerPoint templates.

I said yes anyway.

**What happened**: Spent 12 hours watching YouTube tutorials. Created something that looked like a 5-year-old's art project. Client hated it. Asked for a refund.

Lost the client. Lost 12 hours. Lost my confidence.

**The lesson**: Saying yes to everything doesn't make you versatile. It makes you mediocre at everything.

**What works better**: Pick 2-3 things you're actually good at. Get really good at those. Say no to everything else.

My three things now:
1. Technical writing
2. WordPress fixes
3. Content strategy

That's it. I turn down everything else. Make more money. Do better work. Way less stressed.

## Mistake #6: Not Having Contracts

Client hired me to write 5 articles. We agreed on $500 total.

I wrote all 5. Sent them over. He said "These aren't what I wanted" and refused to pay.

No contract. No written agreement. Just messages on Upwork.

**What I learned**: People will absolutely screw you over if there's no contract.

**What I do now**: Every project gets a simple contract that includes:
- Exactly what I'm delivering
- How many revisions are included
- When payment is due
- What happens if they don't pay

I use a free template from Bonsai. Takes 5 minutes to fill out.

**The rule**: No contract = no work. Ever.

## Mistake #7: Waiting Until I Was "Ready"

This was the biggest mistake.

I spent 3 months "preparing" to start freelancing:
- Built a portfolio website
- Created sample work
- Took online courses
- Read books about freelancing

Made $0 during those 3 months.

**What I should have done**: Started immediately with what I had.

My friend started the same week I started "preparing." He had no portfolio. No website. No samples.

He just started applying to jobs and figuring it out as he went.

**Three months later**:
- Me: Perfect portfolio, zero clients, zero income
- Him: Messy portfolio, 5 clients, $2,400 earned

**The lesson**: Done is better than perfect. Start before you're ready.

## What I'd Do Differently

If I could go back and start over, here's exactly what I'd do:

**Week 1**: Pick ONE skill I already have. Not one I want to learn. One I have right now.

**Week 2**: Find 10 people who need that skill. Offer to help them for a fair price.

**Week 3**: Do the work. Get paid. Get a testimonial.

**Week 4**: Repeat with 10 more people.

No fancy website. No perfect portfolio. No waiting until I'm "ready."

Just: Find problem → Solve problem → Get paid → Repeat.

## The Opportunities I Wish I'd Started With

These require zero money, pay within a week, and actually work:

**Virtual assistant work**: Manage someone's email and calendar. $15-25/hour. No experience needed.

**Proofreading**: Fix grammar and typos. $20-40/hour. If you can write clearly, you can do this.

**Data entry**: Boring but pays. $12-18/hour. Anyone can do it.

**Transcription**: Type what you hear. $15-25/hour. Just need fast typing.

**Social media management**: Post content for small businesses. $200-500/month per client.

All of these:
- Cost $0 to start
- Pay within 1-2 weeks
- Don't require special skills
- Can be done around your class schedule

## The Real Cost of My Mistakes

Let me add it up:

- Dropshipping loss: $500
- Time wasted on multiple platforms: ~40 hours ($480 at minimum wage)
- Underpricing my work: ~$1,200 in lost income
- Tax penalty: $150
- Bad client with no contract: $500
- Time spent "preparing" instead of earning: $2,400

**Total cost**: $5,230

That's a semester of rent. Or a used car. Or a really nice laptop.

All because I didn't know what I was doing.

## What Actually Works

After all those mistakes, here's what I've learned works:

**Start with free opportunities**: Don't spend money until you've made money.

**Focus on one thing**: Master one income stream before adding another.

**Charge what you're worth**: Better to have 3 good clients than 10 cheap ones.

**Save for taxes**: 30% of everything goes straight to savings.

**Get contracts**: Every single time. No exceptions.

**Start before you're ready**: You'll learn faster by doing than by preparing.

**Say no to bad fits**: Not every opportunity is worth your time.

## Six Months After My Mistakes

I finally figured it out.

Now I make $1,200-1,800/month from:
- Freelance writing (3 regular clients)
- WordPress maintenance (2 retainer clients)
- Content strategy consulting (1-2 projects/month)

I work 15-20 hours/week. Around my class schedule. No inventory. No ads. No complicated systems.

Just: Find people with problems I can solve. Solve them. Get paid fairly.

## The Advice I'd Give My Past Self

Stop overthinking it.

You don't need:
- A perfect plan
- A big investment
- Special skills
- Months of preparation

You need:
- One skill people will pay for
- The courage to ask for money
- The discipline to actually do the work

That's it.

## Final Thoughts

I wasted $5,000 and 6 months making these mistakes.

You don't have to.

Pick one simple opportunity. Start this week. Charge fairly. Get a contract. Save for taxes.

You'll make mistakes anyway. Everyone does.

But at least they'll be NEW mistakes. Not the same ones I made.

Learn from my expensive lessons. Start smarter than I did.
