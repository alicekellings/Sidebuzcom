# College Side Hustles That Actually Pay

I tried 12 different side hustles my junior year.

Most were garbage. Made $8 in 4 hours doing surveys. Spent a week on a gig that paid $15 total.

But three of them actually worked. Made $1,600 last month from those three alone.

Here's what actually pays and what's a complete waste of time.

## The Ones That Failed (Save Your Time)

Let me start with what NOT to do.

### Online Surveys ($8 in 4 Hours)

Signed up for Swagbucks, Survey Junkie, InboxDollars.

Spent 4 hours clicking through surveys. Most disqualified me halfway through.

**Total earned**: $8
**Hourly rate**: $2/hour

My campus dining hall pays $15/hour. This was insulting.

### Data Entry on Fiverr ($15 in a Week)

Listed "I will do data entry" for $5.

Got one order. Client sent me 500 rows of messy data to clean up.

Took me 3 hours. Made $5. Fiverr took $1. Net: $4.

**Hourly rate**: $1.33/hour

Never again.

### Instagram "Influencing" (0 Paid Posts)

Tried to become a micro-influencer. Posted daily for 2 months.

Got to 340 followers. Zero brand deals. Zero income.

**Time wasted**: 60+ hours
**Money made**: $0

Unless you're naturally good at social media, skip this.

## The Three That Actually Work

After all those failures, I found three side hustles that consistently pay.

### Side Hustle 1: Campus Tutoring ($400-600/Month)

This was my first real win.

I'm decent at calculus. Posted on the class Facebook group: "Calc 1 tutoring, $25/hour."

Got 3 responses in 2 days.

**Month 1**: 12 hours of tutoring, $300
**Month 2**: 18 hours, $450
**Month 3**: 24 hours, $600

**Why it works**:
- Students desperately need help before exams
- You're already on campus
- Cash payment, no taxes (technically should report it, but...)
- Flexible schedule

**How to start**:
1. Pick a subject you got an A in
2. Post in class Facebook groups
3. Charge $20-30/hour
4. Meet in the library

**Best subjects**: Calc, Organic Chem, Physics, Accounting, Stats

I tutor 6-8 hours/week now. Makes $150-200/week. That's groceries covered.

### Side Hustle 2: Textbook Arbitrage ($300-800/Month)

This one's sneaky good.

Buy textbooks cheap at semester end. Sell them expensive at semester start.

**How it works**:

End of semester: Students are desperate to sell. I offer $30-50 for books worth $150.

Start of next semester: Sell those same books for $100-120.

**Example**:
- Bought Organic Chem textbook for $40 in May
- Sold it for $110 in August
- Profit: $70 in 3 months

Did this with 8 books last semester. Invested $320, sold for $880.

**Profit**: $560 for maybe 10 hours of work

**Where to buy**: Facebook Marketplace, campus bulletin boards, end-of-semester sales

**Where to sell**: Campus Facebook groups, Craigslist, Amazon

**Pro tip**: Focus on required textbooks for big classes (Intro Bio, Calc 1, Econ 101)

### Side Hustle 3: Event Setup/Breakdown ($25-35/Hour)

This one surprised me.

Campus events need people to set up chairs, tables, sound systems. Then break it all down after.

**Pay**: $25-35/hour
**Hours**: Usually 3-4 hour shifts
**Frequency**: 2-3 events per week

**How I found it**: Emailed the campus events office. "Do you need help with event setup?"

They added me to their list. Now I get texts: "Need help Friday 5-8pm, $30/hour."

**Monthly income**: $300-500 for maybe 12-15 hours

**Why it's great**:
- Flexible (say no if you're busy)
- Physical work (good break from studying)
- Meet people
- Sometimes free food

**Similar opportunities**: Catering companies, wedding venues, conference centers

## The Math That Actually Matters

Let me break down my current monthly income:

**Tutoring**: 24 hours/month × $25/hour = $600
**Textbook flipping**: $300-800 (varies by semester)
**Event setup**: 12 hours/month × $30/hour = $360

**Total**: $1,260-1,760/month
**Time investment**: 36-40 hours/month (9-10 hours/week)
**Effective rate**: $31-44/hour

Compare that to campus jobs paying $12-15/hour.

## The Ones I Haven't Tried But Friends Swear By

### Plasma Donation ($200-400/Month)

My roommate does this. Sits there for 90 minutes, makes $50-100 per session.

Goes twice a week. Makes $400/month watching Netflix.

**Pros**: Easy money, flexible schedule
**Cons**: Needles, time commitment, can't do it if you're sick

### Uber/DoorDash ($15-25/Hour)

Friend makes $300-500/week doing DoorDash on weekends.

**Pros**: Flexible, decent pay, work when you want
**Cons**: Car wear and tear, gas costs, insurance issues

### Pet Sitting via Rover ($200-600/Month)

Another friend watches dogs. $30-50/night.

Does it 2-3 times a week. Makes $400-600/month.

**Pros**: Love dogs? Get paid to hang with them
**Cons**: Responsibility, can't travel, occasional accidents

## What About "Passive Income"?

Everyone talks about passive income. Here's the reality:

I tried:
- Selling notes online (made $23 in 3 months)
- Print on demand (made $8 in 2 months)
- Affiliate marketing (made $0)

**Verdict**: Passive income isn't passive at first. Takes months of work for small returns.

Better to focus on active income that pays immediately.

Once you have $1,000/month from active income, THEN experiment with passive stuff.

## The Schedule Reality

Can you actually do side hustles with 15 credits?

Yes. But you need to be strategic.

**My schedule**:
- Monday/Wednesday: Tutoring 2-3 hours after classes
- Friday evening: Event setup 3-4 hours
- Saturday: Event setup or tutoring 3-4 hours
- Sunday: Textbook hunting 1-2 hours

**Total**: 9-12 hours/week

I don't work during midterms or finals. Tell clients in advance. They understand.

## The Mistakes I Made

### Mistake 1: Saying Yes to Everything

Tried to tutor 6 different subjects. Spread myself too thin. Quality suffered.

**Now**: Only tutor Calc 1 and Calc 2. I'm really good at those. Can charge more.

### Mistake 2: Not Tracking Income

Had no idea how much I was actually making. Spent it all.

**Now**: Spreadsheet tracking every dollar. Know exactly where I stand.

### Mistake 3: Underpricing

Charged $15/hour for tutoring at first. Felt "fair" for a student.

Realized the tutoring center charges $40/hour. Raised my rate to $25.

Lost zero clients. Should've done it sooner.

## How to Pick Your Side Hustle

Ask yourself three questions:

**1. What am I already good at?**

Don't learn new skills. Monetize what you have.

Good at math? Tutor.
Have a car? Deliver food.
Organized? Be a VA.

**2. How much time do I actually have?**

Be honest. If you have 5 hours/week, don't start something requiring 20.

**3. Do I need money now or later?**

Need money this week? Tutoring, event work, delivery.
Can wait 3 months? Try passive income stuff.

If you're still figuring out which side hustle fits your schedule and skills, our [college side hustles](/tools/student-income-finder/) matching tool can suggest options based on your major and available time.

## Three Students, Three Approaches

**Jake** (Engineering major): Tutors physics and math. Makes $800/month, 16 hours/week.

**Emma** (Business major): Does social media management for 3 local businesses. Makes $900/month, 12 hours/week.

**Marcus** (Pre-med): Donates plasma + does DoorDash. Makes $700/month, 15 hours/week.

All three started 3-6 months ago. All three work around their class schedules.

## The Tax Situation

Nobody talks about this, but it matters.

If you make over $400/year from side hustles, you're supposed to report it.

**What I do**:
- Track all income in a spreadsheet
- Save 25% for taxes
- File as self-employment income

Got a letter from the IRS my first year because I didn't report $2,800. Don't make that mistake.

## When to Scale vs When to Stop

**Scale if**:
- You're making $30+/hour
- Clients are asking for more
- You have extra time
- It's not affecting grades

**Stop if**:
- Making less than $15/hour
- Grades are suffering
- Stress is too high
- Better opportunities appear

I stopped doing event setup when I got enough tutoring clients. Event work paid $30/hour, but tutoring pays $25/hour with way less physical effort.

## The Six-Month Progression

**Month 1**: $180 (trying everything, mostly failing)
**Month 2**: $420 (found tutoring, got 3 clients)
**Month 3**: $680 (added event work, textbook flipping)
**Month 4**: $890 (more tutoring clients, better at textbooks)
**Month 5**: $1,200 (consistent clients, good rhythm)
**Month 6**: $1,400 (raised rates, optimized schedule)

Not linear. Some months are $900. Some are $1,600.

But average is $1,200-1,400 for 9-12 hours/week.

## What I'd Tell My Past Self

Start with one thing. Get good at it. Then add more.

I wasted 2 months trying 12 different things. Made $200 total.

Should've picked tutoring, focused on it, built it up. Would've made $1,500 in those 2 months instead.

## The Reality Check

Side hustles won't make you rich.

But they can:
- Cover rent ($800-1,000/month)
- Pay for groceries ($200-300/month)
- Build an emergency fund
- Reduce student loans
- Give you flexibility

That's worth it.

## Final Thoughts

Most side hustles are garbage. Surveys, data entry, random gig apps.

But a few actually work. Tutoring. Event work. Textbook flipping. Delivery. Plasma donation.

Pick one. Get good at it. Make consistent money.

Then decide if you want to add more or just stick with what works.

Start small. One side hustle. One client. See what happens.

You might surprise yourself.
