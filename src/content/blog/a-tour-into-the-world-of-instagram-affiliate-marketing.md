As a matter-of-fact Instagram is one the top trending social media platforms which grabs the attention of hundreds of millions of people, and therefore Instagram affiliate marketing is one the top stops for influencers to generate as much following as they can.

Well, it works when an affiliate marketer does a partnership with companies or small- or large-scale businesses who post their products or services on a website. The affiliate marketer then posts the link or customized URL of the respective company in order to pursue a larger audience to visit or buy their products. 

If you succeed in doing so, meaning that someone buys a product originating from clicking on your custom affiliate link, then well done and congratulations – your work is done! Now sit back and wait to get your commission from the company.  

While engaged in affiliate marketing, you can get to know new brands, companies, and find endless opportunities waiting for you promote.

Assuming you do this while sharing valuable information with your Instagram audience, you will enjoy these advantages: 

 	- As your account grows day by day, your audience will love to know about new and trendy brands and you will become more known and end up organically getting more followers. 



 	- It will be advantageous for both the company and the affiliate marketer even in case people would don’t buy the product. At least they will get to know about the product details pleasing the company while also you providing invaluable information to your audience
