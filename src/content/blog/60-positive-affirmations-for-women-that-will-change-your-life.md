Positive affirmations, especially for women, can feel challenging. Weâ€™ve been taught to put ourselves last, prioritizing othersâ€?happiness above our own. Perhaps weâ€™ve even learned that to think of ourselves in a positive light is selfish or conceited. (Trust me, itâ€™s anything but.) But many of us have heardâ€”whether from a well-meaning friend,Â a therapist, orÂ a self-help bookâ€”that practicing positive affirmations in front of the mirror can make a huge difference in our lives. And as strange or as awkward as the experience feelsâ€”itâ€™s true.

Behind these ideas of positive affirmations lies the science ofÂ self-affirmation theory. In essence, it asserts that when we tell (and repeat) our beliefs to ourselves, we can â€œmaintain our sense of self-integrity.â€?But even with science to back it up, Iâ€™ve still felt theÂ imposter syndromeÂ creeping in when I try to practice positive affirmations myself.

## The Importance of Practicing Positive Affirmations for Women

Itâ€™s normal to experience doubt in those moments when you tell yourself something that feels deeply untrue. For example, on a day when nothing seems to be going right, your hairâ€™s doing all sorts of funky things, and a zit decided to show up out of nowhere, it can feel inauthentic to say â€œI experience beauty from within.â€?

> When we practice positive affirmations daily, we not only share kind and loving words with ourselves, but we start to believe them.

My advice?Â *Feel it!*Â Then take a step back, and ask yourself where those emotions are coming from. Is it a feeling of inner doubt or of comparison? Or perhaps itâ€™s motivated by something someone said to you in the past. The point is that when we look deeper into our self-limiting beliefs, we begin to see the faults in these stories weâ€™ve told ourselves. We see how weâ€™ve kept ourselves from stepping into the truth of who we really areâ€?lovely and full of light*.

When we practice positive affirmations daily, we not only share kind and loving words with ourselves, but we start to believe them. While you may not experience an epiphany from any of the positive affirmations below, I will say this: with practice comes promise.
