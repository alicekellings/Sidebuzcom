Whatâ€™s a random item that makes your life easier? I once asked this question to poetÂ Kate Baer, and her reply came immediately: â€œThis phone holderÂ for my car. It sticks onto the vent. You probably donâ€™t need it if you have a fancy car, but mine is not fancy and lacks a place to safely see the map! Thank you, car thing!â€?

Inspired, I purchased car thing for our trusty Volkswagen, and it really does make driving easier. Now we even bring it on trips when we know weâ€™ll be renting a car.

Here are our teamâ€™s answers to the question, and Iâ€™d love to hear yoursâ€?

**Lifesaver:**Â Dimmer switches

â€œMy closest friends tease me because after coming into their apartments and giving them a bottle of wine or stinky cheese, Iâ€™ll sometimes do a quiet sweep, dimming a few lamps and turning off overheads. (I only do it with bffs, of course!) But then we canÂ *truly*Â relax. For our house, I addedÂ dimmer cordsÂ to all table and floor lamps, and now the whole place glows.â€?

**Lifesaver:**Â [Tortilla Warmer](https://bit.ly/3zGOS2W)

â€œI firmly believe that everyone should have a tortilla warmer. Even if you eat them only a couple times a year, itâ€™s a must. After warming tortillas in a pan, you place them in the warmer and they stay perfectly warm and moist for at least 30 minutes. If theyâ€™re just left out on a plate, though, theyâ€™ll get hard and cold and dry within five minutes, which is theÂ *worst*.â€?

**Lifesaver:**Â Extra measuring cup

â€œI recently realized that whenever I was looking for my workhorseÂ measuring cup, it would inevitably be in the dishwasher, and Iâ€™d have to take it out and hand wash it. Not a tragedy, of course, but when I had the aha moment that I could spend three bucks and always have a clean one at my disposal, I couldnâ€™t believe how happy it made me. (My â€˜doubles strategyâ€?has also worked with scissors and Scotch tape.)â€?

**Lifesaver:**Â 10-foot phone charging cable

â€œMy phone was always on the brink of dying because I use it all day for work calls. With aÂ 10-foot charging cable, I can keep it plugged in all the time, no matter where I am in the room, and itâ€™s long enough so it doesnâ€™t get stuck behind the couch.â€?

**Lifesaver:**Â Smart plug

â€œI love the ritual of pour-over coffee, but I missed the convenience of a programmable coffeemaker. Plugging our electric kettle into aÂ smart outletÂ that turns on 15 minutes before my alarm goes off has been a total game-changer. I wake up early to write in the quiet hours before my kids start their day. Itâ€™s so nice to get out of bed knowing thereâ€™s hot water already waiting for me in the kitchen.â€?

P.S.Â Funny do or donâ€™ts, andÂ the best movie Iâ€™ve seen in ages.
