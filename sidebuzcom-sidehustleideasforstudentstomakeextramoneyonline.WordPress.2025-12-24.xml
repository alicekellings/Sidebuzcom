		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="pinit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-url="https://web.archive.org/web/20230514110406/https://camillestyles.com/food/15-best-gluten-free-dairy-free-dessert-recipes/" data-desc="Hands Down, These Are Our Favorite Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Desserts of All Time" data-img="https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/camille-styles-vegan-gluten-free-desserts.jpeg">From cookies to brownies to homemade ice cream, we’ve rounded up our favorite gluten-free, dairy-free dessert recipes that are easy, elegant, and truly crave-worthy. We’ve got options that are also refined-sugar-free, saving your </a>blood sugar from the dreaded spike. So scroll on for our faves and prepare to stun and satisfy everyone on your list.

<em>Note: All recipes can be made gluten and dairy-free. We’ve included some vegan, soy-free, refined sugar-free, and nut-free options, but as always, be sure to carefully read all of the ingredient information to ensure it’s free of any allergens or restrictions you might have. </em>

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230514110406im_/https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/strawberry-shortcake-gluten-free-dairy-free-desserts.jpeg" alt="Gluten-Free Strawberry Shortcake" />

<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>Golden-brown, made-from-scratch shortcakes are the perfect vessel for sweet, fresh strawberries and fluffy whipped (coconut) cream. They’re light on the inside, crispy on the outside, and taste amazing all on their own. That said, they’re made even better by the sweetened strawberries that top them. All you have to do is combine sliced strawberries with powdered sugar and chill while you prep the shortcakes.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>Seriously, the coconut whipped cream will be your new favorite dairy-free alternative. Whip up a little extra to eat with fresh berries, top a pie, or to spoon into your morning coffee for an indulgent treat.

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230514110406im_/https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gluten-free-dairy-free-brownies.jpeg" alt="Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free Brownies" />

<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>These gluten-free dairy-free brownies are as close to the real deal as you can get. They’re fudgy, gooey, rich, and undetectably gluten- and dairy-free. Cane sugar and maple syrup keep things refined sugar-free, almond butter and flax eggs give the brownies the perfect texture, and dairy-free milk, butter, and chocolate chips bring the moisture. Once your batter is mixed, sprinkle with chocolate chips and flakey salt for maximum flavor and visual appeal. The hardest part about this recipe is waiting for the pan to cool before diving in.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>Sea salt goes a long way here. A small sprinkle sends that chocolate flavor over the top.

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230514110406im_/https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peanut-butter-banana-cookies.png" />

<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>Decadent, nourishing, and all-grown-up, this gluten-, dairy-, and refined sugar-free cookie recipe is a gem. By looking at the ingredient list, you’d never know how delicious these cookies are, but believe me—they’re exceptional. They have bits of salty roasted peanuts, chunky peanut butter, and crunchy coconut sugar threaded throughout the dough that makes them oh-so-tasty. Gifting a few of these bad boys to a friend will certainly make their day!

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>The crunchy peanuts on top seal the deal on texture.

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230514110406im_/https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gluten-free-vegan-carrot-cake-cupcakes-1.jpeg" />

<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>Good old-fashioned carrot cake gets a revamp in the form of gluten-free, vegan cupcakes. They’re one of those “cleaned up classics” that you can’t go wrong with. They retain all the flavor and texture of carrot cake—perfectly moist, sweet, and bursting with spiced goodness. These cupcakes are another dessert to make and pack away for your friends, family, or anyone in your circle who could use a pick-me-up.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>To give your cupcakes extra pizazz, grate some walnuts over top of the icing and sprinkle with a dash of cinnamon. It’s the little things.

<h3>Mango Lassi Popsicles</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It:</strong> Need an easy, tasty way to cool down this summer? These lassi-inspired popsicles are your answer. First: the presentation. Gorgeous, right? I love their softly-hued orange appeal, the drizzle of melted white chocolate, and the mix of chopped pistachios and rose petals sprinkled on top. But go deeper and you’ll discover a satisfying blend of mango, coconut milk, yogurt (opt for dairy-free), and some surprising spices that send it all home.

<strong>Hero Ingredient:</strong> Those spices I mentioned? The soft, floral flavor of cardamom and just a pinch of saffron for a subtle, earthy warmth.

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230514110406im_/https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gluten-free-dairy-free-banana-muffins-683x1024-1.jpeg" alt="Banana Pumpkin Muffins" />
<h3 id="h-banana-pumpkin-muffins" class="has-medium-font-size">Banana Pumpkin Muffins</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>I know, I know: it might not yet be time for your PSL, but I’m of the opinion that pumpkin works year-round. (Particularly when it’s paired with banana’s natural sweetness.) Before it gets too hot, I’m making the most of the chilly mornings by heading straight into the kitchen to bake up these fluffy, moist muffins that make the perfect light breakfast or snack. Without any dairy or gluten in sight, they pack tons of flavor: pumpkin purée (of course), maple syrup, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice. You can bet that come September I’ll be in the habit of baking these once a week.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>A little maple syrup (combined with banana and coconut sugar) is all these muffins need to create their naturally sweet flavor.

<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>If you haven’t jumped on the grilled peach bandwagon yet, this is your sign. Grilled peaches maintain all of their juicy sweetness and are made even better by the bitter grill marks that grace the edges. The best part? They only require four ingredients: peaches, olive oil, salt, and honey. If it suits your fancy, a scoop of dairy-free vanilla ice cream brings a creamy coolness to the mix that’s simply mouthwatering. Grill those peaches, people!

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>Fresh basil or mint is a great addition. The herbs’ floral freshness elevates those peaches to new heights.

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230514110406im_/https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/no-churn-mango-basil-ice-cream.jpeg" />

<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>No dessert roundup is complete without homemade ice cream, and this mango-basil version nails it. It’s refreshing enough to enjoy on the hottest late-summer and early-fall days and even carries over well into the season. It’s a healthier dessert that satisfies every sweet craving perfectly. With a velvety texture, fresh fruit flavor, and a little dose of basil’s freshness, you’ll want this one on repeat.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>Coconut milk is the key to super creamy vegan ice cream. Its dairy-free richness lends itself so well to whatever flavors you choose to pair it with.

<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>Vegan and gluten-free chocolate chip cookies that taste great <em>and</em> are better for you? Sign me up. These tasty treats boast oats, walnuts, cinnamon, sea salt, almond butter, chia seeds, and so much more goodness. They’re moist (sorry), chewy, and totally delicious. These cookies are also great for wrapping up and gifting to a friend or packing in your kiddos’ lunch boxes.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>Pro tip: Though the recipe doesn’t call for it, toasting your walnuts beforehand brings an extra nuttiness to the cookie that’s just divine.

<h3>Summer Fruit Fools</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It:</strong> Nothing is simpler—or tastes more like summer—than an easy dessert that dresses up your favorite seasonal berries. These five-ingredient fruit fools are the perfect dinner party treat. Not only are they a low-lift for the hostess, but they boast a beautiful presentation. Layer in cream and any mix of summer berries in parfait glasses. All that’s left to do is spoon up the sweetness.

<strong>Hero Ingredient:</strong> Heavy cream, of course, doesn’t fit into our dairy-free rubric. But simply swapping in coconut cream and whipping along with the lemon zest is an easy substitute.

<h3>Blueberry, Ginger &amp; Coconut Cream Parfait</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It:</strong> This dessert is so easy and virtuous, I might be tempted to make it for breakfast (writes the woman who celebrates Pie Friday without fail after every Thanksgiving). With under ten ingredients, this is a perfect picnic treat or casual dinner party dessert. While it calls for coconut cream, be sure to swap out the honey for maple syrup if you want it to be totally vegan.

<strong>Hero Ingredient:</strong> When summer hits, you can bet I’m looking for all the ways to enjoy blueberries daily.

<h3>Gluten-Free Lemon Bars</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It:</strong> Lemon bars are my forever favorite. Through spring and summer, my mom would make them most weeks, keeping a Tupperware full of the treats available whenever the craving struck. I love the puckery sourness of the filling set against the crisp, crumbly crust. Gluten-free graham crackers help keep these totally gluten-free. And contrary to popular belief, eggs are not dairy products. So you’re all set to indulge as you see fit.

<strong>Hero Ingredient:</strong> How could I <em>not</em> say lemon?

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230514110406im_/https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/healthy-easy-apple-crumble.jpeg" alt="Healthy &amp; Easy Apple Crumble " />
<h3>Healthy &amp; Easy Apple Crumble</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>Naturally sweetened and downright delicious, this easy crumble might be one of the healthiest desserts around. It’s perfect for celebrations, simple dinners, and potlucks alike with its comforting appeal and ease. Whether you opt for crumbles, crisps, or cobblers, one serving of this and everyone’s mind will be blown.

<strong>Hero Ingredient:</strong> The beauty of this crumble is its versatility. Apples are ideal in the fall, but feel free to swap in rhubarb and strawberry in spring, raspberries and peaches in summer—the list goes on.

<h3>Spiced Sweet Potato Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It:</strong> While sweet potato desserts are often served in the fall and winter, we’re fans of the spud all throughout the year. (Clearly.) Of course, this isn’t what you want to serve in triple-digit weather, but if you come across a cool night early on or later in the season, you’ll be happy to have this recipe in your back pocket. The creamy, sweet potato combined with warming spices and a slightly tart frosting is like nothing else. It’s rustic, earthy, and perfectly comforting—as all the best desserts are.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>You’ll never catch me eating buttercream when cream cheese frosting is an option. Dairy-free cream cheese keeps everything light, creamy, and wonderfully smooth.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">The financial markets are a bustling metropolis of data, constantly vibrating with activity and ripe with opportunities for the astute investor. Amidst this flurry, the options market stands out as a beacon, offering a versatile range of strategies that can safeguard, enhance, or supercharge your portfolio.</p>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Yet within this landscape teeming with complexity, traders must deploy every tool available to uncover the subtle signs that might foretell a profitable play. This is where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240302121516/https://www.modestmoney.com/best-unusual-options-activity-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">unusual options activity scanners</a> come into play, the unsung hero in the arsenal of the savviest investors.</p>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">But how do you pick the right scanner to elevate your trading game and sift through the noise to find actionable intelligence? Join us as we decode the complexities of options scanning tools, equipping you with the knowledge to make the most informed decision.</p>

<h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Understanding_Unusual_Options_Activity" class="ez-toc-section">Understanding Unusual Options Activity</span></h2>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Before we plunge into the depths of scanning tools, it’s essential to grasp the concept of unusual options activity. In the realm of options trading, ‘unusual activity’ refers to trading volumes that are higher than normal. This anomalous spike, when discerned through the lens of a scanner, can suggest that market participants with insider knowledge or astute strategists are positioning large sums of capital based on significant impending events or news.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="What_Constitutes_Unusual_Activity" class="ez-toc-section">What Constitutes Unusual Activity?</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">An essential component of spotting unusual activity is establishing what is ‘usual’ for a particular stock or option. This involves understanding historical volume and open interest for various strikes and expirations within a specified timeframe. A common rule of thumb is that any volume or open interest that is at least five times its average can be deemed unusual.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Interpreting_Unusual_Options_Activity" class="ez-toc-section">Interpreting Unusual Options Activity</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Merely identifying heightened activity is not enough; it’s equally crucial to interpret it effectively. For instance, heavy call buying could indicate a bullish outlook, while significant put buying might signal a bearish sentiment. However, the context within which these trades are occurring (current stock price, historical performance, market themes, etc.) is critical in ascertaining the appropriateness of your response to this detected activity.</p>

<h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Essential_Features_of_an_Unusual_Options_Activity_Scanner" class="ez-toc-section">Essential Features of an Unusual Options Activity Scanner</span></h2>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Now that the foundation is laid, it’s time to dissect the critical components of an Unusual Options Activity Scanner. When choosing among the myriad of tools in the market, keep an eye out for the following attributes that characterize a robust scanner:</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="User_Interface_and_Experience_UIUX" class="ez-toc-section">User Interface and Experience (UI/UX)</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">An intuitive and user-friendly interface can make your scanning experience a breeze. Look for customizable dashboards, real-time updates, and the ability to set alerts that cater to your unique trading style.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Data_Aggregation_and_Analytics" class="ez-toc-section">Data Aggregation and Analytics</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">The scanner should collate and present large volumes of data in a cohesive, digestible format. It should offer a suite of analytics tools that allow for on-the-fly evaluations and deep dives into the meaning behind the activity.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Customization_and_Flexibility" class="ez-toc-section">Customization and Flexibility</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Cookie-cutter scanners may not align with your specific trading goals. Flexible scanners that allow you to adjust parameters, filter results, and set personalized thresholds for unusual activity will be a better fit for a range of strategies.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Integration_with_Trading_Platforms" class="ez-toc-section">Integration with Trading Platforms</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">For seamless execution of trades, a scanner that integrates with your preferred trading platform is indispensable. The conduit between detection and action should be as frictionless as possible to capitalize on fleeting opportunities.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Educational_Resources" class="ez-toc-section">Educational Resources</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">While not a core feature, valuable educational content can icing on the cake. Access to webinars, tutorials, and user forums can help traders sharpen their skills and stay abreast of the latest trends in the options market.</p>

<h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Selecting_the_Right_Unusual_Options_Activity_Scanner_for_You" class="ez-toc-section">Selecting the Right Unusual Options Activity Scanner for You</span></h2>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">With the checklist in hand, it’s time to select a scanner that would foster your trading prowess. But remember, there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Traders with different backgrounds, risk appetites, and time horizons will gravitate towards different tools. Here are a few scenarios that exemplify how to align a scanner with your particular needs:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240302121516im_/https://nopassiveincome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/investment-research.png" /></p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="The_Busy_Yet_Methodical_Trader" class="ez-toc-section">The Busy Yet Methodical Trader</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">If you are a trader who values accuracy and methodical research but suffers from time constraints, a scanner that offers detailed alerts and pre-configured criteria might be ideal. These tools often come with a steeper learning curve, but the tradeoff is precise detection that spares you from sifting through reams of data.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="The_Agile_and_Opportunistic_Trader" class="ez-toc-section">The Agile and Opportunistic Trader</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">For the trader who is always on the lookout for the next big move and can act swiftly, a scanner with a high degree of customization and real-time updates is essential. This kind of trader is likely to be comfortable with a more hands-on approach to the scanning process and will appreciate the ability to tweak criteria on the fly.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="The_Novice_Trader" class="ez-toc-section">The Novice Trader</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">New to the stock market? An easy-to-use scanner with educational resources and a supportive community can accelerate your learning curve. Your focus should lie not just in detecting unusual options activity, but in understanding the when, why, and how of leveraging this information.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="The_Proactive_Investor" class="ez-toc-section">The Proactive Investor</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Proactive investors who have a leaning towards risk management and long-term holding can still benefit from an unusual options activity scanner. Look for a tool that not only identifies speculative trades but one that also incorporates strategies for hedging or income generation through options.</p>

<h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="The_Human_Element_in_Automated_Scanning" class="ez-toc-section">The Human Element in Automated Scanning</span></h2>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">While automated scanners are becoming increasingly sophisticated, they still lack the human touch when it comes to judgment calls. Seasoned traders often use scanners as a starting point, supplementing the machine’s findings with their market experience and knowledge. It’s this synthesis of human insight and machine efficiency that can yield the most potent results.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240302121516im_/https://nopassiveincome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/trading-1.png" /></p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="The_Role_of_Intuition_and_Experience" class="ez-toc-section">The Role of Intuition and Experience</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">In the high-stakes game of trading, intuition can often play a pivotal role. The best scanners serve as a compass, guiding you based on concrete data, while your intuition can be the captain, steering the ship based on the broader market context and your own experience.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Staying_Informed_Beyond_Scanning" class="ez-toc-section">Staying Informed Beyond Scanning</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Scanners can tell you what the market is doing now, but a comprehensive understanding of market fundamentals and continuous learning is what will enable you to forecast where it’s heading. Stay informed on company earnings, economic reports, and geopolitical events that can greatly influence the options market.</p>

<h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Final_Thoughts" class="ez-toc-section">Final Thoughts</span></h2>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Unusual options activity scanners have emerged as an invaluable ally for traders seeking alpha in their portfolios. By choosing the right scanner and blending it with your unique style and expertise, you can unlock patterns and opportunities that remain invisible to the unaided eye. Continual refinement and proficiency in using these tools will not just enhance your trading performance but will also deepen your understanding of the dynamics that propel the stock market. In the end, success in the rewarding yet perilous world of options trading is a blend of technology, skill, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Is your dwindling bank account impacting your health? The American Psychological Association (APA) released a survey showing that money stress impacts Americans’ health nationwide. And, as it turns out, the wealthy are also stressed about money — not just those in lower-income households.

You can eliminate some of that financial stress by earning additional income, even if you have a full-time job. Steve Chou of MyWifeQuitHerJob famously started two six-figure businesses while continuing to work at his day job.

<b>Related: <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/105-service-businesses-to-start-today/80684">9 Ideas to Make a Side Income While Growing Your Business</a></b>

Whether you’re looking for cash to launch your startup or make new investments with, or dig out from mounting debt, a few hundred to a few thousand dollars a month can change your life. Here are some extra income ideas to get you started.
<h2>Start a service business</h2>
Launching a service business can be done without a large network, an online presence or much overhead. The easiest way to start is by telling people in your existing network what you’re offering and asking them to spread the word.

Noah Kagan from AppSumo nailed this concept. He decided to see if he could earn $1,000 in 24 hours, starting from scratch. He ended up founding a successful beef jerky subscription business that he gave to one of his students to run.

You can look to his success story and steal his concept with a business like dinner catering, freelance writing or online marketing. Start by crafting a killer outreach email to get yourself up and running in just a few days.

<h2>Invest in real estate</h2>
Becoming a landlord isn’t always practical for those who are employed full-time and already strapped for cash. But you can look at buying a condo or small property in another country as a vacation getaway instead. The price tag is typically cheaper, even when you hire a local property management group to manage renters while you’re away.

Commercial real estate can be a great side hustle and lucrative way to invest and earn passive income, even without a large down payment. Get started with a site like Realty Mogul, and invest in commercial real estate for as little as $5,000. You’ll get vetted deals and access to high-end listings you wouldn’t otherwise find.

<h2>Launch an online resource</h2>
There are lots of different ways to make extra money online. Share your expertise by launching an online course or ebook to help others while you earn passive income. My own ebook, <i>100 Days of Growth,</i> ended up generating more income than my day job. It was a ton of up-front work, but once it was ready to go, it took minimal effort to maintain and to keep up with sales.

If writing ebooks isn’t your strong suit, launch a video course or bootcamp instead. I didn’t stop at books — I also launched a content marketing bootcamp through ContentMarketer.io to help my clients master content-marketing abilities in 10 weeks.

</div>
<h2>Leverage the power of Amazon</h2>
It’s always an admirable goal to launch your own online store and build a customer base, but you’re also talking about wearing many different hats. Asides from using Amazon’s affiliate marketing program to earn passive income, you need to research products, find a manufacturer, market your site and figure out how to fulfill orders. Don’t forget about customer service and refund requests.

Instead, you could sell a product and develop a presence directly on Amazon without the need to take on so many roles. Some sellers even have their products shipped directly to Amazon’s fulfillment center and never touch the product itself.

<h2>Join the sharing economy</h2>
It’s not hard to nail down a few hundred to thousands of dollars a month by leveraging the sharing economy. But it’s not just about renting out your spare bedroom or basement on Airbnb. Rent out your car on Turo and bike to work or carpool instead. Rent out your camera equipment lying around your house on Cameralends, your snowboard or bike on Spinlister or your sailboat on Sailo.

And if you are going to rent on Airbnb, consider helping your revenue skyrocket by renting out your entire house instead, and using the opportunity to visit family or go on vacation.
<h2>Host an event</h2>
You can make good money hosting events without aiming for thousands of sign-ups, vendors and high-profile guest speakers. Instead, form a free MeetUp group on a topic you’re knowledgeable about, like growth hacking, and run free events.

After you secure a loyal following, charge for an event with a reputable guest speaker. Rent out a small, upscale conference room at a nearby hotel, and grow your new MeetUp by hosting exclusive, sought-after events that charge a premium for fantastic content.

<h2>Get paid to do what you’re already doing</h2>
Take inventory of what you’re doing in your spare time. People who love skydiving (like me!) can get certified to teach and do jumps on the weekend. You get to do what you love while earning extra money with an easy side hustle at the same time. Ask your local bar if you can help run its trivia night, or bartend a few nights a week while hanging out and getting to talk to interesting people.

Even if you’re not interested in doing much but relaxing and surfing online, you can earn money by testing websites and recording your opinion with a site like UserTesting.

So, get out there. Use your imagination to start a flow of extra income today.

To help you identify the best ways to make money online, we asked career coaches and marketing professionals this question for their best insights. From offering photography services to writing digital content to working as a freelancer, there are several creative ways recommended to help you start earning a decent income online.

Here are 12 ways to make money online:

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240421211057im_/https://nopassiveincome.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Ways-to-make-money-online.png" />
<h3><span id="Offer_Photography_Services" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Offer Photography Services</b></span></h3>
When you put effort into something you are truly passionate about, earning money online is simple. One activity that can earn you well online is photography, and the best part is that you don’t necessarily need to put in extra hours to achieve it. If you are passionate about capturing artistic shots while traveling, in nature, or even just in locations close to lakes, you can sell those photos to certain photography websites. Additionally, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240421211057/https://nopassiveincome.com/freelance-job-websites/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">work as a freelancer</a> to conduct professional photo shoots for weddings or other special events. One easy way to earn extra money is by focusing on building a solid portfolio of your best work. This may demonstrate your originality and artistic approach to whatever subject you capture with your camera.

<h3><span id="Sell_Others_Stuff" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Sell Others’ Stuff</b></span></h3>
A solid way to make money online is to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240421211057/https://nopassiveincome.com/amazon-marketing-hacks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">sell items</a> on eBay, Amazon, or other sales apps. Most people do this when they just want to get rid of stuff but others make a business out of it. They go to yard sales or advertise to help clean out storage units or garages, pick up cool items cheaply, and resell them for more online.

The trick to making this work is understanding the value of things. Some things are more valuable than they look. Other things are cool but won’t sell. If you can get that knowledge of what something is worth and how well it will sell, you can buy low enough and sell high enough to make some good money.

<h3><span id="Become_a_Social_Media_Manager" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Become a Social Media Manager</b></span></h3>
One of the best ways to earn money online is by becoming a social media manager. Your role is to handle social media accounts from small businesses breaking into the social media space for marketing campaigns and organic engagement with prospective clients. You need to have substantial knowledge of different social media features, peak hours for engagement and audience activity, and communication skills to deliver the right message while keeping everything aligned to the company’s brand.

Nunzio Ross, Majesty Coffee
<h3><span id="Do_Proofreading" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Do Proofreading </b></span></h3>
Virtual proofreading is a high-paying role where you can proofread for an author or content writer. You can earn up to 1500USD per month working freelance as a proofreader. Your role is to check for grammatical errors and correct them. The work of a proofreader comes after the author and editor have done their part, generally. They become the final set of eyes and do the last part of the writing process. It is not a very time-consuming or difficult task as there is flexibility of working hours and environment.

<h3><span id="Establish_Gaming_Or_Cryptocurrency_Channels" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Establish Gaming Or Cryptocurrency Channels</b></span></h3>
Gaming and cryptocurrency are two of the hottest industries right now. And if you can tap into this market, you can make a lot of money. There are two ways to go about making money in this space – streaming and creating content. If you choose to stream, you can live-stream your gameplay on platforms like Twitch and make money from advertisements, donations, and subscriptions. If you choose to create content, you can create videos, tutorials, or articles about gaming or cryptocurrency and sell them on your own website or on platforms like YouTube.

<h3><span id="Offer_Virtual_Assistant_Services" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Offer Virtual Assistant Services</b></span></h3>
Offer virtual assistant services to earn money online. Identify the type of work you can expertly provide. It could be bookkeeping, social media management, sales, customer service, etc. You can look for VA positions from job marketplaces as a freelancer or join a VA agency that trains individuals in different business processes. Preferring the latter would mean doing your best to pass the training stage. This way, you can connect and work with clients who need help in running their businesses.

Abe Breuer, VIP To Go
<h3><span id="Engage_in_Affiliate_Marketing" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Engage in Affiliate Marketing</b></span></h3>
If there’s a subject you’re passionate about, start a website. Write as much content as you can based on keywords surrounding the subject. You can find these keywords with tools like SEMRush or Google Keyword Planner. The key is to get as many blog posts out there as possible so Google starts ranking your blog at the top of search results. Once you’re ranking you can run ads or use affiliate web links to gain a portion of every sale. It takes time but month over month you can see some really impressive returns and even make it your full-time job.

<h3><span id="Run_a_Dropshipping_Business" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Run a Dropshipping Business</b></span></h3>
A dropshipping business allows you to run your own business, without having to spend too much time doing it. The simplest way to do this is to use a service such as that offered by Amazon. All you need to do after signing up is to arrange to have stock delivered to an Amazon fulfillment center from your chosen supplier. Amazon will store your products, list them on their website, dispatch them to customers, and take care of any customer service issues. All you have to do is to ensure that you have stock always available, Amazon will let you know as it runs low, then wait for the monthly payments to arrive in your account. Obviously, there is a charge for this service, but when we consider that very little effort is needed on your behalf, it can be a good way to raise some extra funds.

Colin Palfrey, JollySEO
<h3><span id="Write_Digital_Content" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Write Digital Content </b></span></h3>
If you have the ability to write decently well, then writing ebooks, guides, low-content books, and even writing blog posts for others is a great way to make money online. The ability to publish ebooks and low-content books on Amazon is a blessing for those who have a story or knowledge to share with the world. Even better, these types of digital content can continue to generate income as long as it builds a following and you continue your marketing efforts for the ebook. Writing for other websites via blog posts is another great way to make money online. The more experience you build, the more you can charge.

Dylan Miller, DSM Story Forge
<h3><span id="Offer_Services_at_Virtual_Events" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Offer Services at Virtual Events </b></span></h3>
The world of virtual is here to stay. Therefore, offering virtual services to global companies is how I make 70% of my revenue. Companies find us through various Google searches including “virtual event DJ”, “virtual event emcee”, and “virtual party DJ”. During the height of the pandemic, I was doing anywhere from 5-15 virtual events a week. This led to a word-of-mouth campaign that keeps us sustained despite many offices returning to in-person settings. The ease and accessibility of online team-building exercises continues to be the norm for both remote and hybrid companies, at least once a month.

My company has become such a household name for business, that I continue to get inquiries for virtual conferences and webinars. We started out throwing complementary events for those in lockdown March of 2020. We have since grown to become the highest-rated service with awards from Forbes and Wall Street Journal for keeping virtual engagement and retention high.

<h3><span id="Do_Email_Marketing" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Do Email Marketing </b></span></h3>
Emailing your customers irresistible offers is a proven way to make money online. I absolutely love email as a way to communicate with your customers. Social media algorithms can change at any time, hiding your marketing messages. Email is a direct line to your hard-earned customer. Build your email list by giving people a compelling reason to join. This could be a free ebook, a chance to win a prize, or insider access to your best information. Then use email marketing software to send out your newsletter and offers.

Scott Lieberman, Touchdown Money
<h3><span id="Work_as_a_Freelancer" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Work as a Freelancer</b></span></h3>
Working as a freelancer online is one of the best ways to make money online. A fantastic way to earn money at your own speed is through freelancing. You are in charge of who you work for, how long you work, and how much you charge. Programmers, editors, writers, designers, and others with strong skills may look for employment with businesses that use freelancers on websites like Upwork, PeoplePerHour, Fiverr, or Freelancer.

You simply need to create an account on one or more of these websites and depending on the services you provide, you can eventually advance to high-paying freelancing positions. Create an online portfolio to complement your application on employment sites and increase your chances of being hired for lucrative tasks. Be certain that your pricing structure reflects the time and effort needed to complete each assignment. With just an internet connection, you may work from home for clients anywhere in the world, thanks to the flexibility of freelancing.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Manchester United superstar Bruno Fernandes has likened Chelsea-linked AC Milan forward Rafael Leao to Sonic the Hedgehog following his goal against Salernitana.

Defending champions AC Milan resumed their Serie A campaign following the 2022 FIFA World Cup with a trip to Salernitana on Wednesday (January 4). Leao, who’s being strongly linked with an £86 million switch to Chelsea, was on the scoresheet in the 2-1 victory.

In the tenth minute, he went on a dizzying run down the left-inside channel, rounding off Salernitana’s legendary Mexican goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa and finding the back of the net.

As reported by TalkSPORT, Manchester United superstar Fernandes watched his compatriot Leao in action on Wednesday and shared a clip of his goal as an Instagram story. Fernandes, who played in United’s 3-0 win over Bournemouth, also added an emoji of renowned speedster Sonic the Hedgehog to hail Leao’s dashing run leading up to the goal.

Five minutes after the Chelsea target scored, Sandro Tonali doubled Milan’s advantage. Federico Bonazzolli scored for the hosts in the 83rd minute to make the game interesting, but the reigning champions held on for the win.

Leao also dazzled for Portugal at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, scoring thrice in five games before they were knocked out by Morocco in the quarterfinals.

<h2>Manchester United ace Casemiro impresses in Bournemouth win</h2>
Since his transfer from Real Madrid in August, Casemiro has been impressive at Old Trafford with each passing day. On Tuesday (January 3), the defensive midfielder once again showcased his world-class ability, scoring the opening goal and dominating the midfield in the 3-0 Premier League win over Bournemouth.

In the 23rd minute, Christian Eriksen delivered a tasty free-kick into the box, which Casemiro sumptuously volleyed into the roof of the net. The Brazil international also played 50 accurate passes (85% accuracy), created a big chance, delivered four accurate long balls, made six recoveries, and won two ground duels. Casemiro was chosen the Man of the Match by Manchester United fans.

Luke Shaw (39th minute) and Marcus Rashford (86th minute) were the two other goalscorers at Old Trafford on Tuesday.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tiktok is a great platform for anyone who wants to make money on the internet. It is a very popular social media app that allows you to create short music videos and comedy sketches. It’s similar to Instagram in many ways, but instead of sharing pictures, you can share short-form videos.

Tiktok has a massive user base and is growing every day. It’s a great platform for anyone who wants to make money on the internet, but it can be hard to figure out where to start. If you’re wondering how to make money on Tiktok, this guide will help. It will walk you through the steps needed to start earning money on Tiktok and show you some of the best ways to make money using this platform.
<h2><span id="Go_Viral" class="ez-toc-section"><strong>Go Viral</strong></span></h2>
So, you want to go viral on Tiktok. But how do you do it? Well, there are no surefire ways to make your content go viral. It’s more about creating content that will catch the right people’s attention and organically grow from there. There are, however, some things you can do to increase your chances of going viral. Here are some tips:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Be original</b>. Don’t try to copy other Tiktok users’ content. If someone sees that someone else is already doing something similar, they won’t be interested in yours.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Be unique</b>. Make sure your content is not just funny or interesting, but also unique. If you’re trying to do something that has already been done a million times before, don’t expect people to be interested in yours.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Don’t be afraid to be silly</b>. If you’re trying to make a serious video, don’t expect it to go viral. The best Tiktok videos are usually humorous or weird in some way.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Be relatable</b>. Make sure that your content is something people can relate to and understand easily. This will make them want to share it with others!</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Be catchy</b>. If you want to make a video that people will want to watch again and again, it needs to be catchy. Make sure the song you use is fun and easy to remember, and that your content is entertaining enough that people won’t get bored of it right away.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Create contents.</b> Create compelling contents that people will want to watch again and again. Examples of content you can create are music or lyric videos, vlogs (videos about your day, life, etc.) reviews of products and services, life hacks and tutorials.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Have a clear message.</b> You don’t have much time to make your point, so make sure that the video you create is focused on one thing only. If you’re trying to tell a story and explain something complicated, consider making more than one video.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span id="Sell_T-Shirts_or_Products" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Sell T-Shirts or Products</b></span></h2>
There are a few ways to make money on TikTok, including selling T-shirts and products. You can sell these things directly on your TikTok page, or you can sell them through other platforms like Amazon or Etsy. Here’s how to do it:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Create a brand</b>. The first thing you need to do is create a brand for yourself. This will help people recognize and remember your products, which makes it easier for them to buy from you in the future.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Choose products that fit with your brand and audience</b>. Make sure that the products you sell are relevant to your niche!</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Create a store.</b> You can create your store on TikTok or on another platform like Amazon, Etsy, or eBay. It’s up to you!</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Upload your products and set prices</b>. Once you’ve set up your store, it’s time to upload your products so that people can buy from you.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Promote your store.</b> You’ll need to promote your store in order to get people interested in buying from you! Promote it on social media, at events, and anywhere else that makes sense for your niche.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Affiliate_Marketing" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Affiliate Marketing</b></span></h2>
You can make money by promoting brands and products in your videos. You can use affiliate links to promote products, but be careful about the products you promote. Make sure you are promoting products that you believe in or know about.
<h2><span id="Collaborate_with_Brands" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Collaborate with Brands</b></span></h2>
Collaborating with brands is another way to make money on YouTube. It’s a great way to work with companies that you already know and love, which helps build trust in your audience. If you collaborate with a brand, make sure you are clear about what the brand will provide for free and what they expect from you in return. You should also be able to share revenue from any sales made as part of the collaboration.

<h2><span id="Use_Sponsored_Posts" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Use Sponsored Posts</b></span></h2>
Another way to make money on Tiktok is by using Sponsored Posts. These posts can be text-based or video-based, and they appear in your feed as normal. However, these posts are paid for by brands, so you will be compensated for creating them.
<h2><span id="Create_Patreon" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Create Patreon</b></span></h2>
You can also create a Patreon account and use it to monetize your channel. If you’re unfamiliar with Patreon, this is a platform where people can support creators they enjoy by pledging money on a monthly basis to receive exclusive content from them. This may include access to behind-the-scenes footage, opportunities for Q&amp;As or other types of interactions, early access to new videos, etc.
<h2><span id="Livestream_and_collect_virtual_gifts" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Livestream and collect virtual gifts</b></span></h2>
If you have a large following on TikTok, you can make money by live streaming and collecting virtual gifts. This is similar to how YouTubers use Twitch for live streams and interacting with fans. A screen recorder will allow you to record your live stream so that fans can watch it later on. You can also use a screen recorder to create short videos with commentary, which is another way to make money.
<h2><span id="Conclusion" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Conclusion</b></span></h2>
You can make money on Tiktok.

TikTok is a social media app that was founded in 2016 and has since become one of the most popular apps in the world with over 1 billion users. There are many ways you can make money on Tik Tok, and there are many ways to get discovered. All it takes is some creativity and a lot of hard work. It’s not easy, but it’s possible!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a world where economic stability can seem like a distant dream, taking control of your financial future is more important than ever. Passive income isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a strategic approach to diversifying your income streams and securing financial independence.

At its core, passive income is about making your money work for you. It’s income earned with minimal ongoing effort, a stark contrast to the 9-to-5 grind. The beauty of passive income lies in its ability to generate earnings over time, often with an initial investment of time or resources.
<h2>Understanding passive income</h2>
Passive income isn’t synonymous with “no effort.” It typically involves an initial investment of time, effort or capital. But once established, these income streams require much less active involvement compared to a traditional job.

You will never be truly financially free if you are working. Financial freedom means you are free to pursue anything in life without financial constraints. This is how passive income is so monumental to your financial growth. <b>To be financially free, you MUST have a passive income portfolio.</b> Over time, these streams can grow and compound. This offers you not just stability but also the opportunity for exponential wealth growth.
<h2>Finding your Financial Independence Number (FIN)</h2>
Your Financial Independence Number (FIN) is your monetary amount needed from passive income sources to not rely on traditional active income. In other words, it is the amount you need your passive income sources to make to cover your expenses and not have to work. To find your FIN you want to:
<ol>
 	<li>Add your direct monthly expenses (food, utilities, transport, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Calculate your indirect monthly expenses for one month only (e.g., mortgage: divide annual amount by 12)</li>
 	<li>Add your monthly subscriptions</li>
 	<li>Create a sum total of all three above categories</li>
 	<li>Add a 10% buffer of the sum total (e.g. $5000 = $500)</li>
 	<li>Add the last two categories to create the grand total — this is your monthly FIN</li>
</ol>
Use your FIN number to analyze your investment goals. It is a great starting place to build your passive income portfolio.
<h2>Types of passive income</h2>
The concept of passive income can be broken down into two primary categories:

<b>1. Investment-driven income:</b> This involves putting your money into assets or ventures like stocks, real estate or mutual funds.

<b>2. Resource-based income:</b> This includes leveraging assets you own, such as renting out property or monetizing a skillset through digital products.
<h2>10 strategies for building your passive income portfolio</h2>
Starting doesn’t necessarily require a hefty financial investment. Many passive income strategies can be initiated with minimal funds but require your creativity and commitment.
<ol>
 	<li><b>Energy investing (oil and gas):</b> The elite tier of passive income, very lucrative market and high returns.</li>
 	<li><b>Rental properties: </b>Potentially lucrative but requires management</li>
 	<li><b>Money market accounts:</b> A lower-return interest-earning deposit account</li>
 	<li><b>Index funds:</b> A low-effort, diversified stock market investment</li>
 	<li><b>Dividend stocks:</b> Invest in companies that pay regular dividends</li>
 	<li><b>Small business investments:</b> Tap into equity stakes in local businesses</li>
 	<li><b>Content creation: </b>Leverage your expertise to create and sell digital products</li>
 	<li><b>Creative works: </b>Monetize artistic talents through platforms like Etsy or Shutterstock</li>
 	<li><b>Affiliate marketing:</b> Earn commissions by marketing products on your blog or website</li>
 	<li><b>Asset rentals:</b> Generate income by renting out property, vehicles or equipment</li>
</ol>
<h2>Risk tolerance<b></b></h2>
To understand the right passive income source to begin building your portfolio, you need to know your risk tolerance. Risk tolerance refers to how much risk you can take without impacting your financial security. There are some great risk tolerance calculators online that can analyze this for you. <b>Make sure</b> you complete this step before diving in.
<h2>Accredited investing — top-tier growth</h2>
Now, just as all passive income streams are not created equal, some require you to reach specific milestones to engage with them. These streams often involve you needing to be an accredited investor. Put simply, being an accredited investor means you satisfy one of the two criteria below:
<ol>
 	<li>You have an <b>annual income </b>exceeding $200,000 (or $300,000 together with a spouse) for the last two years, expecting the same in the coming year; and/or</li>
 	<li>You have a <b>net worth</b> exceeding $1 million, not including the value of your primary residence.</li>

Investments with higher returns typically require you to reach this status. This is because they are often off-market and carry higher risk compared to public investments. But just because they have higher risk, doesn’t mean the risk in itself is high — it just means it is higher than publicly available investments. Start by educating yourself on what accredited investing is, and aim towards this as your long-term investing goal.
<h2>Final tips — get educated</h2>
Now that I’ve introduced the concept of passive income to you, and you know the basics, it’s time to learn more. There are some great resources out there that can walk you through this article in greater detail. Download an audiobook on passive income, and play it in the car on the way to work each day. A small amount of growth daily will lead to great results.

There are also some brilliant investing groups online that you can join. Hearing other people’s perspectives and their approaches toward passive income generation can inspire you to take action in your own financial journey.

As always, take action today! Watch another video on passive income, and start to expose yourself to more information on this topic. Beyond investing, your education is your biggest asset. With knowledge, you are unstoppable. I’m cheering you on as you start your financial freedom journey from the sidelines. Here’s to safe and smart wealth generation!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chris Haroun, CEO and founder </i><i>of Haroun Education Ventures</i><i>. It has been edited and condensed for clarity.</i>

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240229110609im_/https://sidebuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/How-a-Side-Hustle-Led-to-a-1-Million-Passive.jpg" alt="How a Side Hustle Led to a $1 Million+ Passive Income Stream" />

After I graduated from business school at Columbia, I worked at Goldman Sachs for five years. Then, I switched to the hedge fund industry, and Citadel hired me and relocated my family to the San Francisco Bay Area. There, I eventually switched to the venture capital sector. And I found that my happiest day at work was always the first day. And then it went downhill, and I couldn’t understand why. I did fine at work, but I thought maybe I was depressed or something. But it was because I hadn’t found my passion.

During the years I worked at other companies, I found that during my annual review, it was always uncomfortable for my bosses because they would say something like, “You’re doing a great job. You’re a top performer. Everybody loves working with you. But can you spend a little bit less time mentoring other people on other teams?” And I always said, “It’s just who I am. I can’t change the DNA of who I am.” I love helping people. So I started teaching.

In 2016, while I was still working in venture capital, I started teaching during the evenings in East Palo Alto.<b> </b>I felt alive helping those students. I loved it. Then I started to teach at a couple of Bay Area MBA universities. One Saturday, I taught a course that I called “MBA in a Day” through the LEMO Foundation, which serves under-resourced student-athletes. And the next day, I just threw up a camera at home and recorded myself for eight hours. Then I uploaded it to the online learning and teaching platform Udemy.

That course has sold close to 500,000 times, generating a passive income stream of seven figures in net profit after all expenses. And I continued to scale: Now, I have 72 other courses on Udemy and nearly two million students across the globe. And although this work can be relatively low-touch from a customer service perspective, the goal isn’t just to make money. It’s to help others. I spend a lot of time helping students, jumping on Zoom calls and answering questions.

The profits from what I do go toward building schools. If you go to Project Magu, you’ll see the first school that I built with one of my students in Rwanda. And with another one of my students, I’m building the second school now in Kenya, about a six-hour drive from Nairobi. It’s a school for girls.

It’s a great sense of purpose for me. When I was at the LEMO Foundation, the founder of that charity told me something that changed me. He said, “You can’t expect to realize your dreams in life unless you help others achieve theirs first.” So we’re all here, as Tony Robbins once told me, to serve others and to help other people. And so that’s what I did.

The pandemic was tragic, but it really pulled forward my vision of the future of education by at least a decade. And I think that in my lifetime, only 50 universities will make it. I think what’s going to happen, ultimately, is that most will deplete their endowments, and then there’ll be a Hail Mary pass to alumni to save the schools, and then people will think to themselves, <i>Why bother going to university unless it’s a great brand like a Harvard or Oxford? </i>The system is elitist to the extent that a lot of children get into top schools because their parents went there or they donated money. Another problem is that you pay $100,000 for 20 hours of class per week, and you graduate without any skills.

In my book <i>101 Crucial Lessons They Don’t Teach You in Business School</i>, I outline the problem with MBA schools. They don’t teach you how to sell. They don’t teach you how to network to get a job. They don’t teach you how to manage your own money. They teach you how to manage other people’s money. They don’t teach you how to present. They don’t teach you how to start a company. Graduate and undergraduate business programs teach you theoretical concepts that were relevant maybe last century. So I think that the sector is ripe for disruption. I think Udemy is going to be the catalyst to kind of change the industry where more people are going to learn online.

What’s more, everybody has something to teach. For instance, there’s a woman named Teresa Greenway who’s a great teacher on Udemy — and she teaches how to bake bread. And it’s an amazing story: Years ago before she started teaching on Udemy, she was in an awful marriage with an abusive husband. It was terrible. And she got the courage to leave him and take her kids with her. So she was living off food stamps, and she thought to herself, <i>What can I do to help other people? What am I passionate about? </i>And she’s passionate about baking bread. So she put up a camera at home, and she started showing people how to make bread on the platform. Again, everybody has something to teach you.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The concept of passive income has been around forever. Since passive income does not have to be actively managed, it is much more scalable. This affords entrepreneurs even more time to pursue both active and passive income opportunities.

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240303103245im_/https://sidebuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Theres-No-Better-Time-to-Start-a-Passive-Income-Business.jpg" alt="There's No Better Time to Start a Passive Income Business than Now" />

I’ve started many of these businesses myself over the last decade, as well as helped others. With this experience in mind, I want to share important steps in preparing to participate in a passive income stream, and what to look out for ahead of time.
<h2>Grow your credit score</h2>
Foremost to building a passive income stream is having a good credit score. This opens many doors for extensive capital, which can be surprisingly cheap. Even if you have the funds sitting in liquid investments, borrowed capital is a better option. A good credit score allows you this capital, which is the lifeblood of any venture.

You should want to maximize leverage, too, never using your own capital when you can make a profit off of someone else’s debt capital. By leveraging debt capital with suitable terms and interest, you maximize your return on select investments while your capital remains intact.
<h2>Cultivate a network</h2>
It’s important to have intellectual resources around you. Picking the right passive income opportunity is not easy. If you have cultivated a network of entrepreneurs that you trust, you can discuss your options and get their intelligent feedback.

The bigger the network, the more valuable it is, so don’t be afraid to share your great ideas with those around you. You can even share your ideas with your broker, yet understand that they may be territorial and worried that you will divert capital away from them.
<h2>Find something proven, and be patient</h2>
Proven passive income streams are aplenty in e-commerce. There is no disputing the benefits, and efficiencies, of ordering online, especially with an increasingly remote workforce. This is one example, but the truth is that the Internet and its capacity for efficiency will spawn new passive income ideas for decades to come.

Before choosing an investment, do your homework and identify others who have been successful with that particular investment before you. Then, don’t expect to be immediately successful, just because they were. It may take a few months longer than you expected, to experience that same level of success. Impatient people rarely succeed as entrepreneurs, as they’re likely to bail out at the first roadblock. To succeed, you must sometimes put in meaningful work, and that often takes more time than you’d bargained for.
<h2>Be careful</h2>
Many people are selling passive income ideas, but with limited expertise behind them. These people are tantamount to used car salesmen. Do your due diligence to determine if experts are creating the engine behind the sales forces approaching you, and whether or not they will be accessible in some form or fashion as you pursue this new venture.

You should also attempt to identify whether or not the purveyor of a particular opportunity has deep pockets. If you burn through the initial capital and have nowhere else to turn to but a traditional bank, that will not be good. Banks have a limited understanding of passive income projects, so you are better off conferring with the purveyor beforehand to make sure that you’ll have access to reasonably priced capital in the unlikely event that you’ll need it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’re looking to kickstart a high-income side hustle in 2024, you’re not alone. Nearly two in five, or 39%, of U.S. adults have a side hustle to supplement their incomes — and pay essential bills, according to a recent Bankrate survey.

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240425040505im_/https://sidebuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/3-Expert-Tips-to-Start-a-Side-Hustle-in-2024.jpg" alt="3 Expert Tips to Start a Side Hustle in 2024 for Extra Cash" />

But where to begin? You might want to consider a side hustle that aligns with your interests or talents. For example, this teacher translated her passion for education into a lucrative online gig, and this 26-year-old’s ChatGPT obsession led to a “simple,” $4,000-a-month side hustle.

Of course, building a successful side hustle can be easier said than done. But millions of Americans <i>are </i>doing it — and can provide invaluable insights when it comes to navigating business ventures of your own.

<i>Entrepreneur</i>‘s Side Hustle Spotlight series shares some of their inspiring stories and helpful advice. Three of them — all of whom have made more than $20,000 per month at least once since launching their side hustles — spill their secrets to success below.

<b>Jeff Neal</b>

Record monthly earnings: $27,000

Neal runs a cricket-breeding side hustle, Critter Depot, out of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

“First, find a product and how to source it,” Neal says. “Don’t spend time, money and energy on building out a website and marketing that website without first knowing which product you are going to sell and where you are going to get that product from. Also, take note of what skills you learn when you start a side hustle. Many side hustles flop, and that’s okay. You will learn many business skills trying a side hustle, and those skills are transferable to your full-time job, which can help you advance in your career. So don’t worry about a side hustle failing. There is much to learn from failure.”

<b>Tara Laczynski</b>

Record monthly earnings: $22,735

Laczynski makes about $150,000 a year working 20 hours a week teaching on Outschool, a live, online learning platform for kids.

“You can find a way to turn your passion into a paycheck,” Laczynski says. “When you love what you do, it’s contagious. Focus on doing things correctly, scaling organically and staying consistent in your product. You must maintain your customer experience when you have one customer or one hundred. Creating sustainable systems, building your support, and keeping a growth mindset are key. You should constantly grow and learn, so seek experts and be open to support.”

<b>Lilly Skjoldahl</b>

Skjoldahl turned her furniture-flipping side hustle into The Furniture Dr.

Record monthly earnings: $37,000

“Be consistent and authentic,” Skjoldahl says. “Network with everyone you can — especially those outside your ‘niche’ or business industry. I’ve learned the most from others who are not in my industry and found unique ways to apply their advice to my own business and niche. I’ve also found that scrolling social media feeds does nothing but limit my creativity and inspiration. The less I scroll, the more creative I become and the better my content and business perform. Never rely on one stream of income. Find many ways to profit from whatever you are hustling, and repurpose everything. And most importantly, work smarter, not harder.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Affiliate marketing is one of the most known (and most lucrative) ways to earn money online.

However, not every blogger can generate a good income from affiliate commissions.

I tell you more, with almost 2 billion websites out there (source “internet live stats“), many will not even be able to generate a single sale.

But let’s look at the glass as half full.

Indeed, many bloggers have taken affiliate marketing a step further and have devoted their entire professional lives to working online.

I’m sure it’s the dream of many of you.

<strong>But what turns a good affiliate into a <em>great </em>affiliate?</strong>

In truth, there is no easy answer, as the range of potential products and services that can be promoted through affiliate marketing means that there has been an equally diverse range of practices and methods used to exploit it.

If you’re completely in the dark about this whole affiliate marketing, though, let me fill you in.

You need to consider some points when choosing the path of making money online with affiliate marketing (this post contains circa 1500 words and takes around 7 minutes to read).
<h2><span id="What_is_Affiliate_Marketing_and_How_Does_It_Work" class="ez-toc-section">What is Affiliate Marketing and How Does It Work?</span></h2>
It’s a relatively modern form of marketing with its roots in the early nineties when companies would hire members of the general public to direct people to their stores.

The reasoning is that people are more likely to trust ‘one of their own than a company drone.

The affiliate marketing of today is essentially the same practice, only online.

Essentially everything boils down to uploading links that direct your viewers to your affiliate partner’s site.

If some of them are going to purchase that product or service, you’ll get a commission out of it.

Generally, the standard is 10-20%, but the commission can be up to 50% or even 70% for specific products.

So basically, the commission amount can fluctuate from as low as $1 up to greater sums, like $1.000, $2.000, or even $10.000, depending on what product or service you are recommending.

Now, when you register for affiliate programs, you will get a unique affiliate link that you will use when promoting that specific product.

This is a tracking URL, which companies (or affiliate networks) use to record if your referral generated the sale.

Every affiliate program you are going to register to has its own terms of service, like, for example, the cookie period.

If this time is set to 30 days, if your visitor uses your affiliate link to check a product web page but decides to buy it within the next 30 days, you will still receive the affiliate commission.

Here are some important affiliate marketing terms you should read about.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Affiliates:</strong> people (webmasters, bloggers) who will use affiliate programs to generate income.</li>
 	<li><strong>Affiliate Marketplace:</strong> You can sign in to find different affiliate programs in a specific niche (for example, ShareASale, ClickBank, Amazon, etc.).</li>
 	<li><strong>Affiliate Link:</strong> the unique tracking link you will receive when signing up for an affiliate program.</li>
 	<li><strong>Commission:</strong> it’s the amount of money you will get for each sale of the specific product or service you promote. Basically, if you recommend registering to an affiliate program and some of your readers will do, you will get a percentage of the commissions this user will generate (for a certain amount of time – generally one year). Some examples? SeedingUp, ValuedVoice.</li>
</ol>
The above-mentioned are just the basic terms you need to know to start your journey in affiliate marketing.

Soon, you will learn about coupons code, URL shorteners, landing pages, and so on.
<h2><span id="Study_and_Research" class="ez-toc-section">Study and Research</span></h2>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230929180441im_/https://nopassiveincome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/website.png" />

Getting the right information is crucial for affiliate marketing, like any other online business.

First of all, it’s about learning SEO and copywriting. Select a niche, make keyword research, target specific terms and write relevant, useful, informing content for your users.

There are tons of courses available on the internet and you should make your research before choosing one. I suggest this one, hosted by The Second Wallet and presented by Vick Strizheus, 8-figure internet entrepreneur and digital consultant.
<h2><span id="Choose_the_Right_Partners" class="ez-toc-section">Choose the Right Partners</span></h2>
Obviously, if your blog adheres to a specific niche, you’ll want to use partners whose products reflect that market.

For example, if you’re running a blog that deals with health and fitness, you should be looking for affiliates that deal with products such as health supplements and gym equipment and services such as personal training. <span data-contrast="none">Maybe you even love skincare and have a routine you want to share with millions of people. Direct sales for organic skincare companies have been increasing recently with the trends toward organic healthcare products. If you already know about skincare, then it makes selling much easier. </span>

<span data-contrast="none">If your blog is less focused, of course, you’ll have potential options, but it’s always best to have a clear, defined focus.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span>

Also, try not to focus on affiliates that only sell small ticket (inexpensive) items and services.

For bloggers who write about WordPress or websites creation, the BlueHost affiliate program gives a $60 commission for each sale.

And when you receive an email in your inbox announcing that you made a sale, you can party!
<h2><span id="Find_a_Balance" class="ez-toc-section">Find a Balance</span></h2>
As a blogger, affiliate marketing can potentially create an enormous amount of revenue for you and whomever it is you’re partnering with. Still, if you’re too heavy-handed with it, your blog could lose its credibility.

As your blog loses credibility, it will lose viewers, and that will send it spiraling down the search engine results ranking, leading your partners feeling like they’ve backed a lame horse.

Be sure to keep your blog stocked with content that isn’t affiliate marketing based, or people will soon see through you, and you’ll lose not only your blog but also any potential revenue you could earn through it.

If your content is not worth reading, then nobody will read it; it really is that simple.

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230929180441im_/https://nopassiveincome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/affiliate-marketing-1024x754.jpg" alt="affiliate marketing circle" />

&nbsp;
<h2><span id="Research_Affiliate_Companies" class="ez-toc-section">Research Affiliate Companies</span></h2>
Unfortunately, as an affiliate, there’s very little chance you’ll be going it alone.

If you really want to make a decent amount of revenue, you’ll need to use an affiliate program.

The company that runs the program will be the ones paying you, so make sure that you do as much research as possible into the companies rates compared to their competitors and ask around to see if the company you’re considering has a good track record with their users.

Most affiliate programs will operate on a ‘pay per click’ or ‘pay per sale’ basis.

With PPC, you’ll get a commission for every person who visits your site and is referred to your affiliate partners’ site through your links. With PPS, you’ll only get your commission if the visitor eventually purchases an item or service from your partner’s site.

Obviously, you’ll generally gain more commission from a PPS system, but the commission will be far more infrequent.

Whether you decide you prefer PPC or PPS depends very much on your own personal preferences but make sure that the company you choose to work for uses the payment arrangement you’re most comfortable with.

&nbsp;
<h2><span id="Produce_HIGH-QUALITY_Content" class="ez-toc-section">Produce HIGH-QUALITY Content</span></h2>
Do you know your audience?

Be sure to promote just those specific products or services relevant to your users and strive to create content that solves their problems or needs.

The first <strong>mistake is “Selling rather than helping.”</strong>

Be sure to write genuine posts to help your audience solving one of their needs or issues, and you will be right on your way to finally generate an income with affiliate marketing.
<h2><span id="Use_the_Right_Tools" class="ez-toc-section">Use the Right Tools</span></h2>
When it comes to affiliate marketing, like any other task online, if you are going to use the right tools, everything becomes much simpler.

First of all, you want to have a blog.
<div class="content-box-blue">

Do you need a completely FREE guide to help you create your first blog and make money with it?
How to Start a Blog (And Make Money With It) – Step by Step Guide

</div>
If you use WordPress, I have a tool to suggest to you.

It’s called the Pretty Links plugin, which will make your affiliate marketing work much easier.

Basically, it helps manage all your affiliate links under one dashboard, making it easy to add them every time you create new content.

Also, you can create groups for your links, cloak, and customize them.
<h3><span id="Conclusion" class="ez-toc-section">Conclusion</span></h3>
I hope this small guide to affiliate marketing is going to help you to get started.

There are many possibilities to earn money on the web. Most of them have in common that you need high-quality content. In fact, check these residual income business opportunities.

To generate truly high-class journalistic content, education is the best way. Open School of Journalism offers a distance education program in journalism with many electives, including online journalism, content marketing, etc.

And you, are you making money with affiliate marketing?

Do you have any other suggestions to add?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-drop-cap">Positive affirmations, especially for women, can feel challenging. We’ve been taught to put ourselves last, prioritizing others’ happiness above our own. Perhaps we’ve even learned that to think of ourselves in a positive light is selfish or conceited. (Trust me, it’s anything but.) But many of us have heard—whether from a well-meaning friend, a therapist, or a self-help book—that practicing positive affirmations in front of the mirror can make a huge difference in our lives. And as strange or as awkward as the experience feels—it’s true.</p>
Behind these ideas of positive affirmations lies the science of self-affirmation theory. In essence, it asserts that when we tell (and repeat) our beliefs to ourselves, we can “maintain our sense of self-integrity.” But even with science to back it up, I’ve still felt the imposter syndrome creeping in when I try to practice positive affirmations myself.

<h2 id="h-the-importance-of-practicing-positive-affirmations-for-women" class="wp-block-heading">The Importance of Practicing Positive Affirmations for Women</h2>
It’s normal to experience doubt in those moments when you tell yourself something that feels deeply untrue. For example, on a day when nothing seems to be going right, your hair’s doing all sorts of funky things, and a zit decided to show up out of nowhere, it can feel inauthentic to say “I experience beauty from within.”
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">When we practice positive affirmations daily, we not only share kind and loving words with ourselves, but we start to believe them.</blockquote>
My advice? <em>Feel it!</em> Then take a step back, and ask yourself where those emotions are coming from. Is it a feeling of inner doubt or of comparison? Or perhaps it’s motivated by something someone said to you in the past. The point is that when we look deeper into our self-limiting beliefs, we begin to see the faults in these stories we’ve told ourselves. We see how we’ve kept ourselves from stepping into the truth of who we really are—<em>lovely and full of light</em>.

When we practice positive affirmations daily, we not only share kind and loving words with ourselves, but we start to believe them. While you may not experience an epiphany from any of the positive affirmations below, I will say this: with practice comes promise.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kick streamer Adin Ross (787K followers) has once again found himself at the center of attention after receiving a verbal warning from Kick CEO Edward “Eddie” Craven. This incident occurred in his in-real-life (IRL) stream (November 6) when he was seen driving and texting while being escorted by police cars.

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208055943im_/https://sidebuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Youre-in-trouble-Adin-Ross-receives-warning-from-Kick.jpg" alt="Adin Ross gets verbal warning from Kick CEO (Image via Kick/Adin Ross)" />

Besides being a dangerous act in itself, texting or using phones while driving is also punishable on some other streaming sites like Twitch. This was echoed by the Kick CEO, who, according to one of Adin’s friends, said:
<blockquote>“You’re in trouble…(for) using your phone while driving. Yeah, Eddie called me.”</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>“What was the actual problem?” – Adin Ross surprised after Kick CEO sends warning</h2>
Adin Ross has a history of engaging in controversial actions during his live broadcasts, which has consistently garnered criticism. This latest incident is no exception, as it was reported that the streamer was caught using his phone while driving during his recent IRL stream.

The streamer and co-owner of Kick was seen escorted out by a couple of police vehicles during his stream. However, he also streamed himself using his phone while driving.

Eddie, who likely witnessed this behavior, promptly contacted one of his friends to emphasize the importance of refraining from such actions, especially in the presence of law enforcement. In response to the warning, Adin expressed:
<blockquote>“For real? What was the actual problem?”</blockquote>
His friend chimed in:
<blockquote>“Don’t use your phone while driving.”</blockquote>
Adin continued:
<blockquote>“F**k. Is that illegal?”</blockquote>
Another co-passenger weighed in:
<blockquote>“To be fair, we can’t be streaming now that we have got police escort and using your phone…”</blockquote>
Before this particular incident, Adin Ross’ mother had to address his behavior when she noticed that he was excessively speeding.

<h3>Fans react to the clip</h3>
The clip was quickly shared across the popular r/LivestreamFail subreddit, which garnered a lot of comments criticizing Adin Ross. Here’s what the community said:

<hr />

Adin Ross isn’t the only streamer who faced consequences for their reckless driving behavior. In August 2023, Yousef “Fousey” was banned from Twitch after he attempted to drive recklessly, played loud music in the car, and simultaneously streamed his actions.

Fousey, who is also a streamer on Kick, was admitted to a mental hospital for more than two months following a recent outburst in front of the police during one of his streams. He has since announced that he plans to resume streaming sometime this month.]]></content:encoded>

This will be the last league-stage game for both teams in the tournament and a must-win encounter at that.</p>
<p data-immersive-translate-walked="81e1b533-1611-4998-8704-370e27c71228" data-immersive-translate-paragraph="1">Punjab Kings have blown hot and cold in IPL 2023 in what has been another disappointing year for them. They began their campaign on an impressive note with close wins over Kolkata Knight Riders (seven runs – D/L method) and Rajasthan Royals (five runs). However, things have mostly gone downhill for them since then.</p>
<p data-immersive-translate-walked="81e1b533-1611-4998-8704-370e27c71228" data-immersive-translate-paragraph="1">PBKS have only won two of their last six matches in IPL 2023. Some hopes were raised of a revival when they beat Delhi Capitals (DC) by 31 runs in the away game. However, in their last match, they went down to the same opponents by 15 runs at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala. The loss dealt a massive blow to their hopes of qualifying for the playoffs.</p>


<hr />

<h2 data-immersive-translate-walked="81e1b533-1611-4998-8704-370e27c71228"><strong data-immersive-translate-walked="81e1b533-1611-4998-8704-370e27c71228" data-immersive-translate-paragraph="1">PBKS need a near-miracle to qualify for IPL 2023 playoffs</strong></h2>
<p data-immersive-translate-walked="81e1b533-1611-4998-8704-370e27c71228" data-immersive-translate-paragraph="1">After 65 league matches in IPL 2023, Punjab Kings are eighth in the points table, with 12 points from 13 games. They also have a poor net run rate of -0.308.</p>
<p data-immersive-translate-walked="81e1b533-1611-4998-8704-370e27c71228" data-immersive-translate-paragraph="1">If Punjab beat Rajasthan in their last league match, they will finish on 14 points, but due to their inferior net rate, it will be next to impossible for them to end in the top four after the conclusion of the league stage.</p>
<p data-immersive-translate-walked="81e1b533-1611-4998-8704-370e27c71228" data-immersive-translate-paragraph="1">To have even a slim chance of qualifying, PBKS will need to hammer RR by a mammoth margin and then hope that Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Mumbai Indians (MI) lose their last league games by very big margins, by such an extent that their net run rates fall below that of PBKS.</p>
<p data-immersive-translate-walked="81e1b533-1611-4998-8704-370e27c71228" data-immersive-translate-paragraph="1">That doesn’t sound like a realistic possibility though, at least not in the case of RCB, who have an impressive net run rate of +0.180. MI, on the other hand, have a net run rate of -0.128.</p>
<p data-immersive-translate-walked="81e1b533-1611-4998-8704-370e27c71228" data-immersive-translate-paragraph="1">Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will also finish on 14 points if they beat Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in their last league game on May 20. However, with a net run rate of -0.256, they are unlikely to move into the top four even with a big win.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-drop-cap">hen it comes to warm-weather food, my mind usually goes to seasonal faves like burgers, watermelon, tomatoes, grilled hot dogs, and corn. But there’s another super springy ingredient that it would be a shame to forget about: pesto! Basil is about as fresh as it gets. And even though you can get great jarred pesto year-round, there’s nothing like some freshly blended pesto in the warmer months to jazz up even the simplest of meals. Since we could all use a little more pesto in our lives, we’ve rounded up the best pesto recipes we could find.</p>
Pesto and pasta go together beautifully, but there is actually so much more that you can do with this delicious condiment. You can drizzle it over a buddha bowl, use it as the base of a pizza, or serve it alongside any protein or veggie. Much like hummus, there are lots of variations on traditional pesto recipes, but today we’re mainly sticking with the OG (barring a few standout exceptions).

Hailing from Genoa, Italy, pesto sauce traditionally consists of crushed garlic, pine nuts, salt, basil, and a hard cheese like Parmigiano Reggiano or pecorino, all mixed together with oil. If you’ve got a food processor, then this is the best time to use it. But that doesn’t mean you can only use pesto on Italian dishes. It goes well with just about everything!

And while the traditional addition of cheese means this tasty spring and summer staple is off-limits for vegans, we have a plant-based recipe that everyone will be raving about. Try this quick and easy vegan pesto recipe that you can whip up at home. And keep reading for 15 of the best pesto recipes on the internet that’ll give you all kinds of inspiration for what to do with it.

<em>Pro tip: Eat the pesto immediately or store it in a sealed jar for up to a week. If you’re storing for later use, pour a generous amount of olive oil atop the pesto to form an oily seal. It will prevent the pesto from turning dark. Stir the oil into the sauce before using it.</em>

<h3>Pesto Gnocchi Skillet Bake</h3>
<b>Why We Love It: </b>A good weeknight pasta recipe is a must during the spring and summer—seasons when you’re trying to minimize your time spent in the kitchen. I kid you not, this recipe calls for only six ingredients and just a few minutes of hands-on time (most of the work is done in the oven). Serve it alongside a fresh green salad with a zippy dressing. Dinner plans, made.

<b>Hero Ingredient: </b>I’m a gnocchi lover, so anytime I see the potato pasta called for in a dish, I instantly swoon. They’re the perfect base for any sauce—pesto in particular.

<h3>Peach, Pesto, and Balsamic Pizza</h3>
<b>Why We Love It: </b>Homemade pizza always hits the spot, and this recipe is a delicious homage to our favorite summer flavors. The combination simply cannot be beaten. You get an herby zing from the pesto, a salty, creamy bite thanks to the mozz, a burst of sweetness from the peaches, and a tang from the balsamic glaze. Yum!

<b>Hero Ingredient: </b>The peaches steal the show on this fantastic pizza recipe.

<h3>Rigatoni with Brussels Sprouts &amp; Kale Pesto</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>This dish is perfect for large groups—it’s easy to double and can be served at room temp. The flavors are unexpected and unmatched. I guarantee everyone will be asking for the recipe.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>I won’t lie: I didn’t expect to love this kale-ified pesto as much as I do. It’s a bit heartier than your standard pesto, and it coats and clings to each tube of rigatoni perfectly.

<h3>Orange-Chili Glazed Pork Tenderloin with Carrot Pesto and Grilled Carrots</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>Prefer carrots as your pesto base? Stay with me. After charring carrots on the grill, you’ll add them to a food processor or blender with mint, garlic, walnuts, olive oil, honey, zest, and the juice of an orange. The flavors are so unique and blend well with this dish’s other players. It’s sweet, spicy, and just a little bit smoky. I won’t blame you if you go in with a spoon.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>A sprig of mint in the pesto and to garnish add beautiful fresh flavor.

<h3>Farinata with Caramelized Onions and Pesto</h3>
<b>Why We Love It: </b>This is a great option if you’re entertaining gluten-free guests. Chickpea flour serves as the base for your farinata, creating a nutty and substantial foundation that you get to pile high with jammy caramelized onions and a hazelnut-arugula pesto that perfectly encapsulates the flavors of spring.

<b>Hero Ingredient: </b>When it’s bright and fresh flavor I’m craving, only arugula will do.

<h3>Avocado Toast with Kale Pesto and Crunchy Veggies</h3>

Pile toasted sourdough with a thick layer of avocado, vegan pesto, a squeeze of honey to taste (just trust), and cucumber or radish for texture. It’s easy to make, colorful, tasty, satisfying, and healthy.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>Is your avocado toast really complete without everything spice?

<h3 id="h-pesto-and-goat-cheese-frittata">Pesto and Goat Cheese Frittata</h3>
<b>Why We Love It: </b>Frittatas are the perfect brunch food, but if you’re like me, then you love to eat them just as much for dinner as well. It’s a one-pan meal that’s easy to throw together, filling, healthy, and satisfying. The pesto gives this frittata a bright, herby zing that goes perfectly with a goat cheese tang.

<b>Hero Ingredient: </b>Goat cheese just makes everything better, don’t you think?

<h3 id="h-burrata-with-pesto-and-figs">Burrata with Pesto and Figs</h3>
<b>Why We Love It: </b>A burrata appetizer is always a crowd-pleaser, but the addition of pesto and figs really kicks it up a notch. It’s an incredibly simple dish that nevertheless feels very elegant. Since figs have a short season, feel free to swap them out with cherries, peaches, or pears.

<b>Hero Ingredient: </b>I bet you thought I was gonna say burrata, but surprise—it’s the figs. Make sure they’re really ripe and sweet since they are the star of this dish.

<h3>Burrata Toasts with Caramelized Walnuts and Mint-Pomegranate Pesto</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It:</strong> In need of an elegant appetizer but short on time? Look no further. These simple toasts are piled high with creamy burrata, sweet and crunchy walnuts, and fresh mint pesto. Because pomegranates are in season during the colder months, feel free to omit if you can’t find them. Who doesn’t love a monochromatic snack?

<strong>Hero Ingredient:</strong> Okay, this time it’s the burrata.

<h3 id="h-pesto-pasta-primavera">Pesto Pasta Primavera</h3>
<b>Why We Love It: </b>It’s so much easier to make than it looks, so you can whip together a seriously impressive dish with minimal effort. As if that weren’t enough, it’s bursting with flavor, is nutritious and healthy, and easy to clean up. Just be sure to chop all your veggies so they’re about the same size to help them cook evenly. You want crisp, tender veggies that don’t get mushy.

<b>Hero Ingredient: </b>Lemon zest is technically an optional garnish, but it adds a brightness and acidity that you won’t want to miss out on.

<h3 id="h-baked-pesto-salmon-with-broccolini">Baked Pesto Salmon with Broccolini</h3>
<b>Why We Love It: </b>As healthy as it is flavorful, this baked salmon recipe only uses five ingredients and still manages to be hearty and filling. It’s the perfect weeknight meal and the salmon makes an excellent vessel for our beloved pesto sauce. Treat yourself to a delicious, flaky protein in just 15 minutes flat!

<b>Hero Ingredient: </b>Broccolini’s tender stalks cook much quicker than broccoli but it’s just as rich in vitamins like A, C, and K, while also being a great source of calcium.

<h3>Roasted Butternut Squash Stuffed with Goat Cheese, Figs, and Pesto</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It:</strong> While I love any and all opportunities to devour butternut squash, I’m not in love with the laborious process of peeling, chopping, and de-seeding the squash. Good news: this recipe streamlines the process. And when your dish is complete, you’re left with a perfectly caramelized vehicle for all your favorites: tangy goat cheese, fresh and salty pesto, figs, and pine nuts for that non-negotiable crunch.

<strong>Hero Ingredient:</strong> As I said, pine nuts: non-negotiable crunch.

<h3 id="h-zucchini-noodle-pesto-pasta">Zucchini Noodle Pesto Pasta</h3>
<b>Why We Love It: </b>Sometimes you just want something that gives you the essence of pasta but isn’t as heavy. That’s where zucchini noodles come in. This is a light and delicious recipe that is easy to throw together and tastes like a dream.

<b>Hero Ingredient: </b>If you’ve never tried zucchini noodles then let this dish be your intro. They’re easy to make if you have a spiralizer. But if you don’t have one you can generally find them already pre-spiraled at your local grocer.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-drop-cap">The holidays have been here for a minute, and if you aren’t already in the midst of festive mayhem, then I’m sure it’s about to sneak up on you. (Like, tomorrow!) Between the parties, planning, and all the presents to buy, our plates are full. And with all the activity comes a packed social calendar. Sure, it’s a lot to manage, but I’m not going to lie—after a few years of engaging solely online, I’m more than a little excited to get dressed up. Thankfully, with a solid capsule wardrobe of heavy-hitting winter basics, your cold-weather mood board is well within reach.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-best-cozy-and-elegant-winter-basics" class="wp-block-heading">The Best Cozy and Elegant Winter Basics</h2>
Our winter basics are those you continue to go back to on a seasonal basis. And sure, in a world of “core” after “core” trend, the idea of finding a timeless piece can feel like a needle-in-a-haystack situation. But don’t worry, no matter the occasion you’re dressing for, these winter basics have you covered.

Every holiday season merits a weekend day full of catching on your holiday gifting list and connecting with friends over a cuppa. For these festive occasions, the focus is on comfort while still incorporating pieces into your ensemble that guarantee compliments. A tailored blazer, cozy but flattering pant, and statement accessories complete the formula. It’s easygoing while still garnering a solid spot on your feed.
<h3 id="h-the-blazer" class="wp-block-heading">The Blazer</h3>
The trick to selecting a timeless blazer is opting for one that moves with the seasons. Your best bet is to go for structure, but with enough give that you can layer dresses, sweaters, and the like underneath. It’s the easiest, chicest addition to any closet.
<h3 id="h-the-tailored-pant" class="wp-block-heading">The Tailored Pant</h3>
IYKYK: Quince’s ultra-stretch ponte pant is a study in blending comfort with style. And because the brand is known for offering quality pieces at an accessible price, you’re welcome to select as many colors as you’d like (the burgundy and olive are my other two faves). But as far as pants that do <em>everything</em> for you—nothing beats Cartolina’s Hallie Pant. I’m wearing the “saddle” colorway above, and I can say with certainty: I’ve never loved a pant more. The high rise and elongating slim leg is beyond flattering—and yes, they do feel like yoga pants. (Tip: these run big, you’ll want to size down.) Your wardrobe of winter basics isn’t complete without them.
<h3 id="h-the-understated-statement-necklace" class="wp-block-heading">The Understated Statement Necklace</h3>
It’s a paradox, but true—we all need a necklace that completes the outfit while subtly making its presence known. I’m wearing the Banana Republic cubic zirconia piece above and love its classic, just-sparkly-enough appeal. Or, create a little more interest in your arsenal of winter basics by opting for a layered piece that still seamlessly ties in with whatever you have on.
<h3 id="h-the-statement-bag" class="wp-block-heading">The Statement Bag</h3>
‘Tis the season for top-handled bags. Mini, but mighty, these statement bags don’t simply make space for the essentials, but also offer a pop of interest for any look. When I’m not pairing my favorite Melie Bianco Cici bag with this exact blazer + pant + necklace formula, I love making it the grounding piece of a monochrome white or black fit. Streamlined and chic.

<h2 id="h-what-to-wear-the-casual-family-gathering" class="wp-block-heading">What to Wear: The Casual Family Gathering</h2>
The key to dressing for family hangs is to go for an elevated comfy look. You don’t want to look like you didn’t try, but you also want to be comfortable enough to roll up your sleeves in the kitchen, play on the floor with little ones, and have something flexible enough to win at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231212014652/https://camillestyles.com/wellness/best-game-night-games/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">competitive game of charades</a>. Consider these your go-to options for an effortlessly cool look.
<h3 id="h-the-chunky-sweater-nbsp" class="wp-block-heading">The Chunky Sweater</h3>
If you have a curvy body type, my recommendation would be to go with a cropped option to define your waistline or to pair it with a high-waisted pant while doing a casual front tuck. This lets you show off your shape even while adding a little volume from the chunky knit.
<h3 id="h-the-perfect-jeans" class="wp-block-heading">The Perfect Jeans</h3>
When it comes to finding the perfect jeans, trust that with a higher price tag comes everything you’re looking for: comfort, quality, and a beyond-flattering look. The good news is that you don’t need anything more than a few go-to pairs for endless outfit combinations. I love a high-waisted bootcut in a darker wash for a universally perfect fit. Again, I’m giving you classic pieces that will never go out of style, so you can feel good about investing in your favorite.
<h3 id="h-the-cozy-slide" class="wp-block-heading">The Cozy Slide</h3>
These Jenni Kayne mules went viral for a reason. They’re the perfect laid-back but still elevated alternative to a classic heel. With the pointed heel and elongated shape, they’re flattering for anyone and pair perfectly with every outfit. Cozy slides are a simple way to upgrade your cozy-casual Christmas outfit. Or, if you really want to lean into the coziness this season, the UGG Tazz slipper is a no-brainer.

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20231212014652im_/https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/camille-styles-christmas-eve-at-home.jpeg" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to Wear: Christmas Eve at Home</h2>
<h3 id="h-the-cardigan" class="wp-block-heading">The Cardigan</h3>
If you run hot and can’t commit to a sweater indoors, cardigans are a solid solution. Layer it with a silk tank top or over a—yep, you guessed it!—slip dress. You can also roll with it and commit with only a bra underneath. Either way, a cardigan is a win-win. Go with a longer cardigan if you want to keep it comfy, or try a cropped style to show off or create the look of curves.
<h3 id="h-the-silk-skirt" class="wp-block-heading">The Silk Skirt</h3>
If you’re not yet sold on the silk dress, give the silk<em> </em>skirt a try. It’s an easy yet comfortable way to elevate your look at home without sacrificing comfort. It comes in a plethora of lengths, but my go-to is the mini. I like to pull out the mini for a night out and keep it classy with a slightly longer hemline for dinner with the family. It looks good with a chunky boot or delicate heel, too. You can keep a slip skirt in your rotation all year, but it’ll be a standout during the holidays.
<h3 id="h-the-hair-bow" class="wp-block-heading">The Hair Bow</h3>
Even Pinterest predicted it—bows are <em>everywhere</em>. They’re the perfect holiday accessory, and the good news is that you’ll be able to keep yours pinned tight throughout the next year. I have The Kate Bow in both black and cream. It’s the perfect Gossip Girl moment to literally tie together any outfit. (The collection of hair accessories was made in collaboration with NYC-based entrepreneur Kira Jones—seriously, her winter basics styling is iconic.)
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20231212014652im_/https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tieghan-gerard-holiday-basics.jpeg" /></figure>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to Wear: Festive Holiday Parties</h2>
When it comes to holiday parties, there are a few materials and textures that will instantly put you in the mood to celebrate. I love the impact of velvet-everything. It goes beyond monochromatic and creates an instant, luxurious appeal. Make a statement in a pants-and-blazer combo or go classic in a midi dress. No matter how you incorporate it into your holiday dressing, you’re sure to look put together in velvet.
<h3 id="h-velvet-everything" class="wp-block-heading">Velvet Everything</h3>
Nothing says the holidays quite like velvet—it can instantly dress up any outfit. One of my favorite velvet pairings is with satin or silk. The juxtaposition of the two fabrics creates such a luxurious vibe. Accessories are always an easy way to add some velvet to your wardrobe, too.
<h3 id="h-a-fur-topper" class="wp-block-heading">A Fur Topper</h3>
Go luxe on luxe with velvet and faux fur—or keep things *relatively* simple by making it your outfit’s go-to statement piece. However you choose to style your faux fur coat, there’s no denying: the material is everywhere this season. And thankfully, there are now plenty of options for beautiful styles at accessible prices.
<h3 id="h-metallic-accessories" class="wp-block-heading">Metallic Accessories</h3>
All that glitters isn’t just gold—it’s also silver, rose gold, and champagne. In a world of metallics, you will always shine. With metallics, I like to follow the rule that less is more. They can be intense in a good way, so use them sparingly.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to Wear: A Cozy Holiday Morning</h2>
For me, holiday mornings are all about keeping it comfortable. I’m talking soft pajamas, warm robes, and elevated loungewear. Whether you’re the matching pajama kind of family or you like to lean more luxe, you can always come back to these pieces. One thing is for sure: you’re bound to create special memories to look back on all while being extra cozy. This lets you focus on what matters most: the magic and joy of your family.
<h3 id="h-the-winter-white-set" class="wp-block-heading">The Winter-White Set</h3>
Don’t get me wrong, I love matching sets in all colors and prints (particularly if you’re coordinating with the fam on Christmas Day). But nothing says classic quite like a winter-white set. Whoever called white after Labor Day a fashion faux-pas certainly never encountered the captivating impact of a luminous sweater-and-pants (or skirt!) pairing. Bonus: The look is elevated enough to take out of the house—but you’ll still feel like you’re wearing pajamas.
<h3 id="h-live-in-activewear" class="wp-block-heading">Live-In Activewear</h3>
If a soft set doesn’t hold up to all you have planned on the big day, let me provide an alternative: elevated activewear. My family has long been the type to venture out for a snowy hike once the presents are opened and we’ve drained the coffee pot. If that sounds familiar, buttery-soft leggings and an oversized half-zip are the way to go. Bonus: If movement is at the top of your list of 2024 intentions, a cute workout set always makes keeping the commitment easier.

Of course, nothing completes a Christmas-at-home ensemble quite like the coziest socks or slippers. Thankfully, brands that do basics to a tee like SKIMS understand that just because we’re prioritizing comfort doesn’t mean we don’t also want to look cute. With the options below, both are 100% possible.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Indian market closed flat with a negative bias for the second consecutive day in a row on Friday. The Nifty50 closed below 19800 levels.

Sectorally, buying was seen in capital goods, utilities, healthcare, and banks while selling was seen in IT, FMCG, oil &amp; gas and consumer durables.

Stocks that were in focus include names like The New India Assurance Company rose 20%, General Insurance Corporation gained more than 16% and Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company (SPARC) closed with gains of nearly 6% to hit a fresh 52-week high on Friday.

We have collated a list of three stocks that either hit a fresh 52-week high, or all-time high or saw a volume or a price breakout.

We spoke to an analyst on how one should look at these stocks the next trading day entirely from an educational point of view:

<em>Analyst: Riyank Arora, Technical Analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd</em>

<strong>The New India Assurance Company Ltd: LTP Rs 209</strong>

The stock has given a strong breakout above Feb 2021 highs with a sharp rise in volumes. With the price rising over 20% in a single day, the overall momentum looks strong.

The stock has a minor resistance at 219 – above which the current up-move can accelerate towards 250 and 266.

If the stock re-tests 195 to 200 zone; it would offer a good buy opportunity with a stop loss below 187.50 for targets of 250 and 266.

<strong>General Insurance Corporation of India: LTP Rs 307</strong>
The stock showed a sharp move, rising over 16% in Friday’s trading session. There is an immediate resistance at 320 for the stock, above which we can see 335 and 385 coming in.

Overall, the structure looks very strong with the stock making higher highs and higher lows indicating a sharp up-trend.

Any breakout above the level of 320 should bring in a strong momentum rally towards 335 and 385 in a spree of up-move.

<strong>SPARC: LTP Rs 273</strong>
The stock has given a good breakout on its daily and weekly charts, giving a strong closing above the 267.50 mark.

With a sharp rise in volumes, the momentum looks very strong for a poised up-move towards 290 and 300, with a firm stop loss set near the 256 mark.

The stock has also made a Cup &amp; Handle Breakout Pattern on its daily charts showing signs of a good positive up-move in the coming few weeks.

Strong technical structure coupled with huge volumes is a big positive sign for the stock.

<h2 id="h-a-plant-forward-future" class="wp-block-heading">A Plant-Forward Future</h2>
At the end of December, we shared our 2024 wellness forecast. And if one thing’s for certain, it’s this: trending food predictions are plant-forward. In fact, the Mediterranean diet holds the <em>No. 1 Best Diet Overall—</em>a lifestyle that champions fruits, veggies, whole grains, beans, nuts, legumes, herbs, and spices. (Ahem, plants!) Sustainable, plant-based cooking is the future. Speaking of, as longevity goals increase, produce-forward diets will follow suit. This shift is twofold. It recognizes the importance of ethical food choices <em>and </em>the nutritional density of plants. A compassionate approach to nourishment is here to stay.

<h2 id="h-is-veganism-worth-the-hype" class="wp-block-heading">Is veganism worth the hype?</h2>
IYKYK—the landscape of nutrition is <em>vast</em>. Unfortunately, it’s filled with misinformation and inaccurate health claims. So if you’re confused about what to put on your plate, you’re not alone. Ultimately, the goal is to take the stress out of eating. Food is joy, after all!

The aim is to cultivate a feel-good, gut-friendly, and balanced approach to food. For some, that means prioritizing a vegan diet. With its health benefits and positive impact on the environment, veganism is soaring. And while this lifestyle isn’t for everyone, there’s no doubt that plants are paramount.
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240425090900im_/https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vegetarian-chickpea-stew.jpeg" alt="Vegetarian chickpea curry." /></figure>
<h2 id="h-can-you-get-all-the-nutrients-you-need-on-a-plant-based-diet" class="wp-block-heading">Can you get all the nutrients you need on a plant-based diet?</h2>
Yes! Adopting a plant-based or vegan diet <em>can</em> provide all the essential nutrients required for optimal health. That said, it often necessitates careful planning and a mindful approach. Plant-based diets— rich in colorful produce, nuts, legumes, etc.—provide everything from ample protein to energizing carbs and immune-supporting antioxidants. However, certain nutrients (those abundantly found in animal products), may require special attention. Think: vitamin B12. Fortunately, that’s where fortified foods and supplements shine. With intentionality in mind, a diverse, plant-based diet can easily provide all necessary nutrients.

<em>Consider consulting with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to design a balanced, plant-based diet to meet your nutritional requirements.</em>

<h2 id="h-more-protein-less-meat" class="wp-block-heading">More Protein, Less Meat</h2>
Across the board, we’re becoming savvier grocery shoppers—particularly when it comes to protein. <em>Hooray! </em>We’re inching further away from the disguises of a faux burger (with a laundry list of ingredients) and moving toward simple, non-meat protein sources. And this Whole Food Markets’ 2024 Trend Report proves it. As the year unfolds, we’ll be stocking up on protein sources made from whole foods (edamame, beans, walnuts, mushrooms, seeds, buckwheat, sprouted grains, etc.) to meet our muscle-building goals. Sayonara, complex meat alternatives.

<h2 id="h-vegan-seafood-is-making-waves" class="wp-block-heading">Vegan Seafood is Making Waves</h2>
Carrots as lox? Trumpet mushrooms as scallops? Root veggies (konjac) in sushi rolls and poke bowls? You betcha. What started as a subtle dip in the plant-based seafood pond is becoming a head-first submergence. In response to the tinned fish trend, vegan food brands are making their own versions of salty, seafood-esque snacks. We’re jazzed about Mind Blown’s new sea scallops, Seed to Surf’s tinned snow crab, and Konscious sushi rolls. And if you’re ready for watermelon nigiri, book a table at everyone’s favorite plant-based restaurant, Planta.

<h2 id="h-fuel-your-gut-with-plants" class="wp-block-heading">Fuel Your Gut with Plants</h2>
We’ve only explored the tip of the gut health iceberg, but there’s no denying its influence. And it’s no secret that a diverse gut microbiome has benefits beyond digestive health. Think: cognitive function, hormones, mood, sleep quality, and more. With digestion a priority, pre- and probiotics will be rising stars in 2024. And where can you get them? Plants. From kimchi and sauerkraut to tempeh, miso, and pickled veggies, probiotics are a dime a dozen. Fiber-rich prebiotics (food for probiotics) are even more accessible—bananas, blueberries, spinach, onions, artichokes, and oatmeal. Plant-based eating does the gut good.

<h2 id="h-quiet-luxury-food-edition" class="wp-block-heading">Quiet Luxury: Food Edition</h2>
The “quiet luxury” trend has its hands in the fashion industry, but it’s only a matter of time before the food world gets a bite. What will this look like? Consumers will splurge on the little things: high-quality olives, locally made vegan cheeses, and unique items to help elevate the everyday—like chili-forward spices. Below are elevated plant-based foods you don’t want to miss in 2024.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Climax Foods Cheese</h3>
Vegan brie, feta, chèvre, and blue cheeses, anyone? If you’re new to Climax Foods, thank us later. This brand is using science to mimic animal-based ingredients like casein (which gives cheese its stretchiness). You can already find these cheeses at several restaurants—including three Michelin–star Atelier Crenn—but you’ll soon be able to shop them at specialty retailers.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Seeductive Foods Cheese</h3>
More plant-based cheese, please. Seeductive Foods’ hemp- and pumpkin seed–based cheeses are packed with heart-healthy omega-3s and vegan protein. Plus, they’re fermented to give them a gut-healthy tang. Uplevel your charcuterie board with a bundle of non-dairy cheese.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mellody Vegan Honey</h3>
As sweet and thick as the real stuff, Mellody’s vegan honey is the world’s first plant-based honey. And trust us, it doesn’t disappoint. From cooking to baking to mocktail-ing, this sweetener is worth the hype.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Outstanding Stuffins</h3>
Crunchy snacks are pantry staples. The newest to our shelves? Outstanding Stuffins. Available in three flavors—Chedda, Nacho Cheese, and Pizza Partay—all of them are deliciously dairy-free. Kiss the munchies goodbye with these crowd-pleasing bites.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">S’NOODS Spicy Miso Ramen</h3>
Another snack we can’t stop raving about? S’NOODS spicy miso ramen. This vegan, gluten-free, and flavor-packed snack is great for grabbing on the go. If you’re craving instant ramen, this will (totally) satisfy.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Shroomeats</h3>
Move over, faux meat patties. Shroomeats mushroom-based meats are packed with flavor and texture and have only six simple ingredients. Serve ’em up with your favorite burger buns and condiments.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Zeroe Vegan Caviar</h3>
The pièce de résistance of silent luxury? Caviar. If you didn’t think plant-based caviar existed, think again. Zeroe makes a vegan version from responsibly sourced seaweed—and it’s pure culinary bliss.

As we step into 2024, the era of plant-based foods is looking more promising than ever. Sustainable (and delicious!) meat alternatives are at our fingertips. Best of all, they’re appealing to a broader audience of eaters: those seeking healthier, environmentally conscious choices. From simple dairy substitutes to flavorful plant-based snacks, the year ahead promises a culinary adventure. Together, let’s make plants a priority.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What’s a random item that makes your life easier? I once asked this question to poet Kate Baer, and her reply came immediately: “This phone holder for my car. It sticks onto the vent. You probably don’t need it if you have a fancy car, but mine is not fancy and lacks a place to safely see the map! Thank you, car thing!”

Inspired, I purchased car thing for our trusty Volkswagen, and it really does make driving easier. Now we even bring it on trips when we know we’ll be renting a car.

Here are our team’s answers to the question, and I’d love to hear yours…

<strong>Lifesaver:</strong> Dimmer switches

“My closest friends tease me because after coming into their apartments and giving them a bottle of wine or stinky cheese, I’ll sometimes do a quiet sweep, dimming a few lamps and turning off overheads. (I only do it with bffs, of course!) But then we can <em>truly</em> relax. For our house, I added dimmer cords to all table and floor lamps, and now the whole place glows.”

<strong>Lifesaver:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240303084220/https://bit.ly/3zGOS2W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Tortilla Warmer</a>

“I firmly believe that everyone should have a tortilla warmer. Even if you eat them only a couple times a year, it’s a must. After warming tortillas in a pan, you place them in the warmer and they stay perfectly warm and moist for at least 30 minutes. If they’re just left out on a plate, though, they’ll get hard and cold and dry within five minutes, which is the <em>worst</em>.”

<strong>Jenny Rosenstrach, food columnist</strong>
<strong>Lifesaver:</strong> Extra measuring cup

“I recently realized that whenever I was looking for my workhorse measuring cup, it would inevitably be in the dishwasher, and I’d have to take it out and hand wash it. Not a tragedy, of course, but when I had the aha moment that I could spend three bucks and always have a clean one at my disposal, I couldn’t believe how happy it made me. (My ‘doubles strategy’ has also worked with scissors and Scotch tape.)”

<hr />

<strong>Maureen Heffernan, marketing director</strong>
<strong>Lifesaver:</strong> 10-foot phone charging cable

“My phone was always on the brink of dying because I use it all day for work calls. With a 10-foot charging cable, I can keep it plugged in all the time, no matter where I am in the room, and it’s long enough so it doesn’t get stuck behind the couch.”

<hr />

<strong>Kaitlyn Teer, contributing editor</strong>
<strong>Lifesaver:</strong> Smart plug

“I love the ritual of pour-over coffee, but I missed the convenience of a programmable coffeemaker. Plugging our electric kettle into a smart outlet that turns on 15 minutes before my alarm goes off has been a total game-changer. I wake up early to write in the quiet hours before my kids start their day. It’s so nice to get out of bed knowing there’s hot water already waiting for me in the kitchen.”

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>
<h3 id="h-maple-bourbon-punch" class="wp-block-heading">Maple Bourbon Punch</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>This maple bourbon punch is a holiday favorite in my household. It’s naturally sweetened from honey and vanilla and a bit zesty thanks to the orange juice. Add in some rosemary sprigs for an herbal touch, and you have yourself a great all-around drink to sip on.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>Make this punch in a large bowl and try the orange and rosemary ice ring included in this recipe! It’s a true <em>pièce de resistance</em>.
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240222133200/https://camillestyles.com/food/pomegranate-champagne-cocktails/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240222133200im_/https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pomegranate-spice-champagne-cocktail.jpeg" alt="pomegranate spice cocktail" /></a></figure>
<h3 id="h-pomegranate-spice-champagne-punch" class="wp-block-heading">Pomegranate Spice Champagne Punch</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>Pomegranate anything pairs perfectly with winter dishes. This champagne punch utilizes the flavor in a subtle and sweet way, with the addition of fresh fruit and spices from cinnamon sticks. Cointreau is the perfect liquor to enhance this recipe with its orange-based flavor.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>Fresh mint leaves are a great garnish to add a visually-pleasing pop of green.

<h3 id="h-herbal-infused-bourbon-apple-cider" class="wp-block-heading">Herbal Infused Bourbon Apple Cider</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>When the temperatures dip, the first cozy drink I think of is apple cider. I’m a big fan of everything spiced when it comes to winter drinks, and this recipe does just that in an herbal-infused way. Add in some fresh apples for a crunchy topping for the coziest sipper.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>A sprinkle of cinnamon never hurt anyone.

<h3 id="h-boozy-peppermint-hot-chocolate" class="wp-block-heading">Boozy Peppermint Hot Chocolate</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>If apple cider isn’t your forte when it comes to hot holiday cocktails, this boozy peppermint hot chocolate might just win you over. All you need to throw together this winter fave is vanilla liqueur, cocoa, peppermint extract, and a few pantry staples you’re bound to have on hand.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>You can’t forget whipped cream for hot cocoa.

<h3 id="h-lillet-rose-spritz" class="wp-block-heading">Lillet Rosé Spritz</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It:</strong> Okay, hear me out: a Lillet rosé spritz deserves a spot beyond your summer happy hour. While the drink is perfectly refreshing on a hot day, I also love its citrusy tang and effervescent sparkle during the holidays. Serve it at your next gathering and expect your guests to be pleasantly surprised.

<strong>Hero Ingredient:</strong> If you haven’t yet enjoyed Lillet rosé, add it to your cart, stat. With notes of red berries, orange blossom and grapefruit, it’s a complex but easy-sipping apéritif.<strong>
</strong>

<h3 id="h-camille-s-pomegranate-punch" class="wp-block-heading">Camille’s Pomegranate Punch</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>This pomegranate punch is a great recipe for serving a holiday crowd. The Mandarin vodka and champagne don’t go overboard on flavor, and allow the orgeat (almond) syrup and pomegranate juice to really bring forward this bevvy’s freshness.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>Garnish to your heart’s content with orange slices, cinnamon sticks, or fresh mint.

<h3 id="h-mistletoe-kiss-cocktail-from-half-baked-harvest" class="wp-block-heading">Mistletoe Kiss Cocktail from Half Baked Harvest</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>I’ve personally never seen a more festive cocktail than this one from Half Baked Harvest. With homemade ginger honey syrup, pomegranate juice, and lime mixed with festive Campari, vodka, and orange liqueur, it’s the perfect cocktail for brightening up any room during the winter months.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>The sugar-dusted rosemary is the icing on the cake for me.

<h3 id="h-spiced-cinnamon-bourbon-hot-toddy-from-minimalist-baker" class="wp-block-heading">Spiced Cinnamon Bourbon Hot Toddy from Minimalist Baker</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>When I see a seasonal menu that features a hot toddy, I can’t help but indulge in the warming flavors. Brightened up with a squeeze of lemon juice and sweetened with homemade simple syrup, there ’twas never a better drink to gather around a fire and cozy up with.

<strong>Hero Ingredient: </strong>Red chili pepper gives this cocktail a unique kick of heat.
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240222133200/https://bakerbynature.com/white-christmas-margaritas/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240222133200im_/https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/simple-mulled-wine-865x1297.webp" alt="simple mulled wine_holiday cocktails" /></a></figure>
<h3 id="h-white-christmas-margaritas-from-baker-by-nature" class="wp-block-heading">White Christmas Margaritas from Baker by Nature</h3>
<strong>Why We Love It: </strong>While your traditional margarita can be found year-round here in Texas, I occasionally like to mix it up with a unique holiday twist on the classic cocktail.

Kennedy, Aristotle, and Leonardo da Vinci weren’t shy about getting their afternoon shut-eye. From revolutionary thinkers to astounding artists, these leaders prove that power napping is far from a lackadaisical personality trait. In fact, it might *just be* the secret sauce. Entrepreneurs swear by this unconventional productivity hack to beat fatigue and maintain focus throughout the day. Because time is of the essence (ahem, my power nap is calling), let’s dive into how to power nap like a pro. Plus, get the secrets for your best night’s sleep. The days of feeling tired all the time are a thing of the past.</p>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240425091230im_/https://sidebuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Your-Ultimate-Guide-to-Feeling-Refreshed.jpg" alt="Your Ultimate Guide to Feeling Refreshed" />
<h2 id="h-why-sleep-is-so-important" class="wp-block-heading">Why Sleep Is So Important</h2>
There’s no denying how important quality sleep is. Our sleep-wake cycle (also known as our circadian rhythm) impacts <em>everything</em>. Think: appetite, blood sugar, metabolism, hormone health, and more. This is no surprise, but most of us aren’t getting enough sleep. Nor, for that matter, are we getting enough sunlight. Distractions abound throughout the day, putting many of us in a sleep deficit. Instead of prioritizing a good night’s sleep, we reach for multiple cups of coffee throughout the day to keep us going.

It bears repeating: our current lifestyle habits aren’t doing us any favors. Working at night and being exposed to artificial light before bed disrupts our circadian rhythm. In turn, this disruption downgrades our overall health and well-being. Ultimately, an inconsistent and dysregulated circadian rhythm causes stress on the body. One way to relieve this stress and get your energy levels back into check? A solid midday nap.
<h2 id="h-how-the-circadian-rhythm-works" class="wp-block-heading">How the Circadian Rhythm Works</h2>
As mentioned, our circadian rhythm influences everything from our eating habits to our body temp, hormone release and digestion. It’s our internal timekeeper. The circadian rhythm maintains our sleep-wake cycle, helping us fall asleep and wake up in the morning. While it differs from a woman’s infradian rhythm (also known as our ‘second clock’), the circadian rhythm deserves just as much love and attention as any other facet of our self-care routine. This rhythm ebbs and flows during the day, but it is best supported by sleep-promoting habits.

The following habits create a nourishing environment for the <em>tiny yet mighty </em></a>part of the brain that controls our sleep-wake cycle.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">1. Get sunlight—especially in the morning</h3>
Even if it’s overcast, head outside! Research shows that (bright) morning light can be effective against insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, and seasonal affective disorder. The melatonin precursor, serotonin, is also affected by exposure to daylight.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">2. Eat a healthy breakfast within 30-60 minutes of waking</h3>
This keeps our blood sugar happy, metabolism revved, and takes the body out of fight-or-flight mode. The energy from what we eat also wakes us up.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">3. Incorporate movement throughout the day</h3>
It’s a crucial part of any healthy daily routine. Exercise has a myriad of benefits, but it’s also been shown to improve sleep efficiency and duration in both kids and adults.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Keep naps short</h3>
While we’ve all been tempted to indulge in a longer nap, a quick snooze is often best. More on this, below!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">5. Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and alcohol before bed</h3>
Caffeine can delay the timing of your body clock and alcohol disrupts our sleep architecture. Learn more about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240425091230/https://camillestyles.com/wellness/when-to-drink-coffee/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the best time to</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240425091230/https://camillestyles.com/wellness/when-to-drink-coffee/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">drink coffee</a> to optimize your caffeine rituals.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">6. Limit electronics in the evening</h3>
Or, be sure to wear blue-blocking glasses. Blue-blocking glasses, specifically, encourage your body to produce optimal melatonin levels close to your desired bedtime. That way, you can fall asleep faster and stay asleep throughout the night.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">7. Build a consistent sleep schedule</h3>
We are creatures of habit. Routines—including a bedtime routine—offer a way to promote health and wellness through structure and organization. Having a routine can greatly improve your health. Experiment with different tools that can support a solid night’s sleep. Splurge on a sleep mask you love, try out a weighted blanket, invest in an alarm clock, and explore the best earplugs on the market.

<a class="pinit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-url="https://web.archive.org/web/20240425091230/https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-power-nap/" data-desc="Power Nap Like a Pro—8 Tips to Getting the Energy and Rest You Need" data-img="https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pouring-tea-how-to-power-nap.jpeg">Armed with an understanding of why sleep is so important, let’s talk about the ever-coveted power nap. Even if it’s not something you can prioritize during the week (or even in this </a>season of your life), it’s helpful to know what it is, how to implement it, and why it could be a total game-changer.

While there’s no medical definition of a power nap, in general, the term refers to short naps ranging from about 10 to 30 minutes. It isn’t long enough to make you groggy or interrupt your sleep cycle—rather, it’s meant to encourage a full-body reset.
<h2 id="h-what-are-the-benefits-of-power-napping" class="wp-block-heading">What are the benefits of power napping?</h2>
Even if you aren’t sleep deprived, a power nap can be beneficial. In essence, they help refill your tank. An efficient (yet effective) afternoon nap has many benefits. If you’re a seasoned power napper, you know the perks. An afternoon nap can help you feel less sleepy and lead to improvements in: mood, alertness, productivity, creativity, reaction time, short-term memory, focus, concentration, and more.

While there aren’t many cons to power napping, it’s important not to sleep too long during the day. (Or to view power napping as a substitute for a good night’s sleep.)
<h2 id="h-how-long-should-you-power-nap-for" class="wp-block-heading">How long should you power nap for?</h2>
Depends, but most agree that <em>over </em>60 minutes can disrupt your circadian rhythm. Furthermore, studies show that a 10-minute afternoon nap is the most effective in improving alertness and productivity. Many experts advise a 15-30 minute nap, as anything longer gets you into deeper stages of sleep, making it that much harder to wake up. If you’re looking for restorative sleep and have the time to spare, see how you feel with an hour-long nap. Compared to a shorter nap, 60 minutes can lead to greater improvement in cognitive functioning.

All of that said, if you only have five minutes to spare, just close your eyes! A brief rest is better than no rest.

Be it your work schedule, parenting responsibilities, or the stress it causes (because you’re ruminating over your to-do list), consider a different reset activity. Rather than napping, you may reap the benefits of a brisk walk, a minute of squats and pushups, or brewing a cup of </a>calming tea. Furthermore, if you tend to wake up feeling disoriented—or more tired than before the nap—focus on clocking your zzz’s at night.
<h2 id="How-Power-Napping-Boosts-Productivity" class="wp-block-heading">How Power Napping Boosts Productivity</h2>
A study conducted by the National Sleep Foundation found that a 40-minute nap improves productivity by 34%. Relatively speaking, that’s not a small percentage. Are you an employer? If so, consider how a power nap could work its way into your company’s handbook. With sleep deprivation negatively influencing the global economy—and studies showing that instituting sleep-friendly policies can improve productivity by over 30% (and alertness by up to 100%!)—allowing employees to rest in the workplace is a win-win. A power nap could drastically change your workplace<em> and</em> directly influence profits. You heard it here first.
<h2 id="h-napping-during-the-workday" class="wp-block-heading">Napping During the Workday</h2>
Speaking of napping at work, did you know that a weekday nap is encouraged in countries around the world? For example, there is the tradition of the <em>siesta</em> in Spain. In China, people take an hour break midday to rest. In Japan, <em>inemuri</em> means napping while present and is seen as a sign of hard work.

In the United States, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240425091230/https://www.cdc.gov/workplacehealthpromotion/initiatives/resource-center/pdf/WHRC-Brief-Sleep-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CDC</a> recommends dedicated physical space—as well as scheduling—to allow for napping. Many organizations have already incorporated nap rooms into their offices. Google, NASA, and Ben &amp; Jerry’s support napping by providing specific spaces like “napping pods” for their employees.

<h2 id="h-4-steps-to-becoming-a-power-napper" class="wp-block-heading">4 Steps to Becoming a Power Napper</h2>
Ready to take the perfect power nap and wake up feeling refreshed? Follow these four rules to get the most bang for your power nap buck.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Get the time right. </strong>The circadian rhythm is low between 2-4 p.m. To improve your alertness, productivity, memory, and function, aim to take your nap in the early-to-mid afternoon. There are many activities you can do to beat the afternoon slump, but a quick power nap could be the golden ticket.</li>
 	<li><strong>Recharge with the ideal duration.</strong> One of the keys to successful power napping is its length. Too much takes you into deep sleep mode, leaving you tired and groggy afterward. Too little is not enough. Experts explain that the maximum power nap recharge is achieved by going from stage one sleep (that lovely ‘drifting off’ feeling) to stage two (slowdown of brain activity). In most people, that’s 15-30 minutes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Create a dark environment.</strong> Just like ideal nighttime sleep comes from a cold, dark room, so does your afternoon nap. The fewer intrusive sounds, the better.</li>
 	<li><strong>Turn your phone on ‘Do Not Disturb.’ </strong>Because we all know how easy it so to get distracted by messages, alerts, etc., block your calendar during nap time and silence your messages. Trust that you can clock 15-30 minutes of rest without tending to other people’s needs. In fact, I bet you’ll tend to their needs with <em>extra </em>enthusiasm after your power nap.</li>
</ol>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Navigating the financial markets as a day trader or an independent investor can be both thrilling and fraught with challenges. The allure of high stakes and high returns often comes with a significant entry barrier in terms of capital. Proprietary trading firms, or prop firms, offer a unique solution, allowing traders access to capital and a platform to grow, sometimes without requiring an upfront evaluation.</p>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the critical steps of choosing a prop firm that aligns with your trading objectives and values. We’ll explore the nuances of prop trading, focus on firms that offer a non-evaluative approach to recruitment, and highlight the key features you should consider to ensure a fruitful partnership.</p>

<h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Understanding_Proprietary_Trading_and_the_%E2%80%98Evaluation_Paradigm" class="ez-toc-section">Understanding Proprietary Trading and the ‘Evaluation’ Paradigm</span></h2>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Proprietary trading refers to financial trading activities where a firm’s capital is used to trade on behalf of the company, rather than trading on behalf of the firm’s clients. Traditionally, prop firms have employed a model where prospective traders undergo an evaluation process. This process typically involves depositing a certain amount of one’s own capital, and the firm’s resources and trading platform are only unlocked upon successful completion of the evaluation terms, usually including profit targets and risk limits.</p>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">However, the landscape is changing, and a newer wave of prop firms are emerging, which do not follow the traditional evaluation model. These firms recognize the potential in traders beyond their ability to pass a one-size-fits-all evaluation. Instead, they offer opportunities based on skill, performance, and potential without upfront financial risks for the trader.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240425105037im_/https://sidebuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-Independent-Traders-Guide-to-Prop-Firms-without-Evaluations.png" alt="The Independent Trader’s Guide to Prop Firms without Evaluations" /></p>

<h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="The_No-Evaluation_Prop_Firm_Advantage" class="ez-toc-section">The No-Evaluation Prop Firm Advantage</span></h2>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Prop firms that do not require evaluations offer some distinct advantages to traders looking to enter the prop trading industry:</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Lower_Barriers_to_Entry" class="ez-toc-section">Lower Barriers to Entry</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">By omitting the evaluation requirement, these firms significantly lower the financial barriers to entry for traders. This allows a broader pool of individuals, including those with limited capital, to participate in professional trading environments.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Focus_on_Skill_Over_Entry_Capital" class="ez-toc-section">Focus on Skill Over Entry Capital</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Non-evaluative prop firms prioritize a trader’s skill and potential over the size of their initial investment. They provide a more meritocratic approach, where talent and hard work are the primary indicators of success.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Learning_and_Mentorship" class="ez-toc-section">Learning and Mentorship</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">These firms often have robust education and mentorship programs designed to support traders in enhancing their skills and learning the intricacies of professional trading. This guidance can be invaluable and is often not offered in the same capacity by traditional prop firms.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Supportive_Environment" class="ez-toc-section">Supportive Environment</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">For many independent traders, the support and resources of a prop firm, such as access to advanced trading technology and the wisdom of experienced mentors, can be a game-changer. Non-evaluative firms recognize the benefits of fostering a supportive community to help traders succeed.</p>

<h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="The_Criteria_to_Consider_When_Choosing_a_No-Evaluation_Prop_Firm" class="ez-toc-section">The Criteria to Consider When Choosing a No-Evaluation Prop Firm</span></h2>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">When selecting a non-evaluative prop firm, consider the following key criteria to ensure that you’re making an informed and strategic decision:</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Trading_Capital_and_Profit-Sharing" class="ez-toc-section">Trading Capital and Profit-Sharing</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">How much trading capital will you have access to, and what is the profit-sharing arrangement? Look for firms that offer a fair split, one that provides you with a significant portion of the profits you generate.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Risk_Management_Policies" class="ez-toc-section">Risk Management Policies</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">A responsible risk management framework is crucial. Understand the firm’s approach to managing risk on their traders’ behalf and how this aligns with your own risk tolerance and trading style.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Platform_and_Technology" class="ez-toc-section">Platform and Technology</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">The trading platform is your toolset. It needs to be robust, intuitive, and able to execute trades swiftly and accurately. Evaluate the technology the firm provides and ensure it supports your preferred trading strategies.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Education_and_Support" class="ez-toc-section">Education and Support</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">A strong support system is invaluable. Consider the quality of the education resources and the available support from the firm’s team. A good firm will provide ongoing training, coaching, and responsive technical support.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Community_and_Networking" class="ez-toc-section">Community and Networking</span></h3>

He highlights the increased profitability and reduced risk that came with trading larger notional sizes.</p>

<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Applying to a non-evaluative prop firm differs from traditional processes. It involves highlighting your trading history, demonstrating your skill through performance metrics, and often participating in simulated trading exercises. Here’s how to succeed in the application process:</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Prepare_a_Robust_Trading_Plan" class="ez-toc-section">Prepare a Robust Trading Plan</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Develop a comprehensive trading plan that outlines your strategy, risk management principles, and potential for profits. This should also include an analysis of the markets you intend to trade.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Focus_on_Consistency_and_Discipline" class="ez-toc-section">Focus on Consistency and Discipline</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Non-evaluative firms are looking for traders who can consistently apply their strategies with discipline. Ensure that your historical performance demonstrates these attributes.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Demonstrate_Continuous_Learning_and_Adaptation" class="ez-toc-section">Demonstrate Continuous Learning and Adaptation</span></h3>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Leverage_Networking_and_Community" class="ez-toc-section">Leverage Networking and Community</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Before, during, and after the application process, engage with the trading community associated with the firm. This not only helps you understand if the community is a good fit but can also provide insights and tips for a successful application.</p>

<h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="The_Future_of_Non-Evaluative_Proprietary_Trading" class="ez-toc-section">The Future of Non-Evaluative Proprietary Trading</span></h2>

The future looks bright for traders who are talented and willing to put in the work, especially with the supportive environment these firms offer. The scalability of trading larger notional sizes with shared profit agreements can lead to substantial gains, creating a win-win situation for the trader and the firm.</p>

<h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Conclusion" class="ez-toc-section">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Choosing a non-evaluative prop firm represents a significant decision and a step toward a potentially lucrative and fulfilling career in proprietary trading. By considering the criteria outlined in this guide, you’ll be well on your way to selecting a firm that values your talent, provides the support you need, and offers a platform for limitless growth.</p>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Proprietary trading is not without risk, and even the best prop firms cannot guarantee success.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">The financial markets are a bustling metropolis of data, constantly vibrating with activity and ripe with opportunities for the astute investor. Amidst this flurry, the options market stands out as a beacon, offering a versatile range of strategies that can safeguard, enhance, or supercharge your portfolio.</p>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Yet within this landscape teeming with complexity, traders must deploy every tool available to uncover the subtle signs that might foretell a profitable play. This is where unusual options activity scanners come into play, the unsung hero in the arsenal of the savviest investors.</p>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">But how do you pick the right scanner to elevate your trading game and sift through the noise to find actionable intelligence? Join us as we decode the complexities of options scanning tools, equipping you with the knowledge to make the most informed decision.</p>

<h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Understanding_Unusual_Options_Activity" class="ez-toc-section">Understanding Unusual Options Activity</span></h2>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Before we plunge into the depths of scanning tools, it’s essential to grasp the concept of unusual options activity. In the realm of options trading, ‘unusual activity’ refers to trading volumes that are higher than normal. This anomalous spike, when discerned through the lens of a scanner, can suggest that market participants with insider knowledge or astute strategists are positioning large sums of capital based on significant impending events or news.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="What_Constitutes_Unusual_Activity" class="ez-toc-section">What Constitutes Unusual Activity?</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">An essential component of spotting unusual activity is establishing what is ‘usual’ for a particular stock or option. This involves understanding historical volume and open interest for various strikes and expirations within a specified timeframe. A common rule of thumb is that any volume or open interest that is at least five times its average can be deemed unusual.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Interpreting_Unusual_Options_Activity" class="ez-toc-section">Interpreting Unusual Options Activity</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Merely identifying heightened activity is not enough; it’s equally crucial to interpret it effectively. For instance, heavy call buying could indicate a bullish outlook, while significant put buying might signal a bearish sentiment. However, the context within which these trades are occurring (current stock price, historical performance, market themes, etc.) is critical in ascertaining the appropriateness of your response to this detected activity.</p>

<h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Essential_Features_of_an_Unusual_Options_Activity_Scanner" class="ez-toc-section">Essential Features of an Unusual Options Activity Scanner</span></h2>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Now that the foundation is laid, it’s time to dissect the critical components of an Unusual Options Activity Scanner. When choosing among the myriad of tools in the market, keep an eye out for the following attributes that characterize a robust scanner:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240302121516im_/https://nopassiveincome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/trading.png" /></p>

<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">An intuitive and user-friendly interface can make your scanning experience a breeze. Look for customizable dashboards, real-time updates, and the ability to set alerts that cater to your unique trading style.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Data_Aggregation_and_Analytics" class="ez-toc-section">Data Aggregation and Analytics</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">The scanner should collate and present large volumes of data in a cohesive, digestible format. It should offer a suite of analytics tools that allow for on-the-fly evaluations and deep dives into the meaning behind the activity.</p>

<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Cookie-cutter scanners may not align with your specific trading goals. Flexible scanners that allow you to adjust parameters, filter results, and set personalized thresholds for unusual activity will be a better fit for a range of strategies.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Integration_with_Trading_Platforms" class="ez-toc-section">Integration with Trading Platforms</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">For seamless execution of trades, a scanner that integrates with your preferred trading platform is indispensable. The conduit between detection and action should be as frictionless as possible to capitalize on fleeting opportunities.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Educational_Resources" class="ez-toc-section">Educational Resources</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">While not a core feature, valuable educational content can icing on the cake. Access to webinars, tutorials, and user forums can help traders sharpen their skills and stay abreast of the latest trends in the options market.</p>

<h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Selecting_the_Right_Unusual_Options_Activity_Scanner_for_You" class="ez-toc-section">Selecting the Right Unusual Options Activity Scanner for You</span></h2>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">With the checklist in hand, it’s time to select a scanner that would foster your trading prowess. But remember, there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Traders with different backgrounds, risk appetites, and time horizons will gravitate towards different tools. Here are a few scenarios that exemplify how to align a scanner with your particular needs:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240302121516im_/https://nopassiveincome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/trading-1.png" /></p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="The_Busy_Yet_Methodical_Trader" class="ez-toc-section">The Busy Yet Methodical Trader</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">If you are a trader who values accuracy and methodical research but suffers from time constraints, a scanner that offers detailed alerts and pre-configured criteria might be ideal. These tools often come with a steeper learning curve, but the tradeoff is precise detection that spares you from sifting through reams of data.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="The_Agile_and_Opportunistic_Trader" class="ez-toc-section">The Agile and Opportunistic Trader</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">For the trader who is always on the lookout for the next big move and can act swiftly, a scanner with a high degree of customization and real-time updates is essential. This kind of trader is likely to be comfortable with a more hands-on approach to the scanning process and will appreciate the ability to tweak criteria on the fly.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="The_Novice_Trader" class="ez-toc-section">The Novice Trader</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">New to the stock market? An easy-to-use scanner with educational resources and a supportive community can accelerate your learning curve. Your focus should lie not just in detecting unusual options activity, but in understanding the when, why, and how of leveraging this information.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="The_Proactive_Investor" class="ez-toc-section">The Proactive Investor</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Proactive investors who have a leaning towards risk management and long-term holding can still benefit from an unusual options activity scanner. Look for a tool that not only identifies speculative trades but one that also incorporates strategies for hedging or income generation through options.</p>

<h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="The_Human_Element_in_Automated_Scanning" class="ez-toc-section">The Human Element in Automated Scanning</span></h2>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">While automated scanners are becoming increasingly sophisticated, they still lack the human touch when it comes to judgment calls. Seasoned traders often use scanners as a starting point, supplementing the machine’s findings with their market experience and knowledge. It’s this synthesis of human insight and machine efficiency that can yield the most potent results.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240302121516im_/https://nopassiveincome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/investment-research.png" /></p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="The_Role_of_Intuition_and_Experience" class="ez-toc-section">The Role of Intuition and Experience</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">In the high-stakes game of trading, intuition can often play a pivotal role. The best scanners serve as a compass, guiding you based on concrete data, while your intuition can be the captain, steering the ship based on the broader market context and your own experience.</p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Staying_Informed_Beyond_Scanning" class="ez-toc-section">Staying Informed Beyond Scanning</span></h3>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Scanners can tell you what the market is doing now, but a comprehensive understanding of market fundamentals and continuous learning is what will enable you to forecast where it’s heading. Stay informed on company earnings, economic reports, and geopolitical events that can greatly influence the options market.</p>

<h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span id="Final_Thoughts" class="ez-toc-section">Final Thoughts</span></h2>
<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Unusual options activity scanners have emerged as an invaluable ally for traders seeking alpha in their portfolios. By choosing the right scanner and blending it with your unique style and expertise, you can unlock patterns and opportunities that remain invisible to the unaided eye. Continual refinement and proficiency in using these tools will not just enhance your trading performance but will also deepen your understanding of the dynamics that propel the stock market. In the end, success in the rewarding yet perilous world of options trading is a blend of technology, skill, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Sometimes waiting for the right moment in a company’s billing cycle can get you a better deal. For instance, some platforms might offer discounted rates for a two-year subscription if you sign up towards the end of their financial quarter.</p>

<p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]" dir="ltr">Loyalty to a particular platform can often result in better negotiation of rates – think of it as the long-term strategy.

<div>

The allure of starting a home business has never been stronger, with many people either supplementing their 9-to-5 income or leaving their day jobs altogether to follow their creative entrepreneurial dreams. With the rise of easier-to-navigate ecommerce platforms and social media marketing, people are finding unprecedented opportunities to turn passion into profit.

One in three Americans report having a side hustle, and it can be easy to see why with all of the tools available to make entrepreneurial aspirations a reality. Starting a home apparel printing business is just one option for the more creatively inclined.

Though you may not have any idea of how to begin a home printing business, many people just like you begin with a little corner of their home, some equipment and a few good ideas to get started. With the right approach to design, quality materials and customer service, those who decide to begin home apparel printing businesses can enjoy wide profit margins, not to mention the satisfaction of being one’s own boss.
<h2>A solid side hustle</h2>
Several aspects of the home apparel printing business make it an excellent side hustle option. Think about all of the places you go in a day — the grocery store, your kid’s soccer game, PTA meetings or your day job. There is one constant among people and what they are wearing: customization.

People love clothing that shows off their personality, their favorite band or a quirky saying that endears them to a particular social group. There is never a shortage of people who will be willing to shell out for custom-designed apparel, whether it’s fun t-shirts, team uniforms or accessories.

In addition, startup costs for a home apparel printing business can be relatively low compared to other side hustle options. Many custom printing machines can be purchased at a relatively affordable price, flexible payment options are available, and materials are readily available either online or even at your local hobby shop. You can stock up on t-shirts, sweatshirts, tote bags or even hats and other accessories in bulk or take advantage of sales to get yourself started and enter the market without breaking the bank.

This side hustle is also extremely flexible and great for busy parents, people with day jobs or even those with other side hustles because it can easily be integrated into your existing schedule. Operating out of one’s home also adds further flexibility while reducing business overhead.

A home apparel printing business is also extremely scalable. As demand and access to resources grow, side hustlers can expand their businesses as they see fit. This can include growing the online portion of one’s business for more passive income, leveraging new community connections for larger custom apparel orders or offering new, unique printed products.
<h2>Getting started</h2>
To get started with a home apparel printing business, you must follow some key steps.
<h3>1. Research and plan</h3>
Do some digging into the market to see where you can add value that may currently be missing. There are multiple printing options available, and each has its pros and cons.

One of the newest and most popular methods on the market, particularly for home-based businesses, is direct-to-film printing. Also known as DTF printing, it does not require pretreatment of the garment, the hot melt powder that is used bonds directly to any material, and you can print on bulkier items that would be otherwise impossible with other printing options. In addition, DTF transfers can be cut and stored for later use, meaning decorators can print their most popular designs in bulk for a more streamlined customization process.

The versatility of DTF printing contributes to it being the most popular choice for at-home printing businesses overall. The demand for customized apparel has led to DTF printing nearing a market value of $1.7 billion by 2026.
<h3>2. Invest in the right equipment</h3>
Once you complete your research and know what kind of approach you want to take, invest in the best equipment for the kind of printing you’d like to do. Keep an eye on quality, first and foremost, to get your side hustle off on the right foot.
<h3>3. Design and creativity</h3>
Think about starting a portfolio of designs for your business. For example, if you are catering to local sports teams, they may have ready-made designs. Or if you have a great idea for a unique apparel design, you can easily take it from idea to reality with design software.
<h3>4. Marketing</h3>
Today, marketing is multifaceted and multilayered. Set up social media accounts for your new business, network face-to-face within your community, and get people to wear your creations where they will be seen and noticed. Sit down and work out a comprehensive marketing plan that can help grow your business to new heights.
<h3>5. Be ready to pivot</h3>
Even the smallest of side hustles need to grow and adapt. Within your apparel printing business, that may mean taking on larger commissions, going after group orders or hopping onto fashion trends when they emerge. The most successful side hustlers are the ones who can shift with the market.

Those with an entrepreneurial spirit and a creative vision could thrive with a home-based apparel printing business. This particular side hustle goes beyond just t-shirts and printed designs — it’s about savvy marketing, brand building and chasing a creative outlet. The world is waiting for your unique vision, so roll up your sleeves, fire up your printer, and start your entrepreneurial journey on your terms!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Grace Ryu, a 23-year-old content creator based in Houston. The following has been edited for length and clarity.</i>

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240425102227im_/https://sidebuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/How-to-Diversify-Your-Income-Into-Multiple-Revenue-Streams.jpg" alt="How to Diversify Your Income Into Multiple Revenue Streams" />

I quit my tech job in March 2023 to explore other income streams. My 9-5 took up too much of my time, and I wanted to focus on ways to make money while I was sleeping or traveling.

Chasing different income streams aligns with my personality — it satisfies my desire to explore and try as much as possible. If I grow bored with one area, I can shift my focus to another, and if one stream isn’t that profitable, I have others to fall back on.

Here’s a breakdown of my eight income streams, with earnings, difficulty level, and time spent each week:
<h2><b>1. Luxury picnic business</b></h2>
<h3><b>Easy rating: 9/10</b></h3>
<h3><b>Lucrative rating: 7/10</b></h3>
I run a luxury picnic business with my best friend and my boyfriend. We initially posted our products on Facebook Marketplace and school flyers and broke even the first week of promoting them.

We re-invested all that money into expanding the business model, like buying more equipment for group picnics. We’ve since worked with businesses like Kendra Scott, local hotels, and Texas A&amp;M University.

We have a six-person team, so I no longer do the physical setup and tear down, and I only put in one hour a week. During March through May, October, and November (peak picnic months), I can take home up to $3,000 a month.

It’s easy and affordable to start and doesn’t require many skills besides having an eye for aesthetics. It’s also lucrative because profit margins are very high since there are little to no variable expenses.
<h2><b>2. Influencer brand deals</b></h2>
<h3><b>Easy rating: 8/10</b></h3>
<h3><b>Lucrative rating: 10/10</b></h3>
I’m a micro influencer, and I have a TikTok account where I post about my life, my streams of income, and product promotions.

Brands reach out and ask me to post a dedicated or integrated TikTok video. I used to make content for brands for free, but now I charge at least $1,000 per post.

I spend around one hour a week on brand deals. At first, making content and editing was hard because I had to get used to the software and apps. After doing this for two years, I’m very fast at it because I know exactly which clips to add and how to do voiceovers.

It takes time to build a following on a platform, but once you get to that point, it’s very easy to work with brands for sponsorships. I make between $1,000 and $2,000 per post for about an hour of work.
<h2><b>3. Affiliate marketing</b></h2>
<h3><b>Easy rating: 7/10</b></h3>
<h3><b>Lucrative rating: 9/10</b></h3>
I started doing affiliate marketing through Amazon’s influencer program and make anywhere from $500 to $2,000 monthly.

In my TikToks, I feature work-from-home essentials from Amazon and link them. Then, people go to my storefront and buy through the links, and I get paid a commission.

It takes about five minutes to apply for the program, but you have to have a social media profile that promotes content.

If you never post anything, you’ll likely get rejected. I have friends who only have a few hundred followers, but they make unboxing videos, so they were accepted.

Anyone can do affiliate marketing because it’s easy to start, but the money isn’t always guaranteed. It takes lots of time and patience on any social media platform for a post to go viral, which will bring in sales. Once that happens, money comes in fast over a few months, and it’s all passive income.
<h2><b>4. User-generated content</b></h2>
<h3><b>Easy rating: 4/10</b></h3>
<h3><b>Lucrative rating: 8/10</b></h3>
User-generated content (UGC) differs from sponsorships because it’s content for brands to use directly. I used to work with a lash company, which paid me to make TikToks, but I don’t post that content on my account.

I have a few retainer clients, which means I’m paid a regular monthly fee in exchange for a set amount of content.

I earn about $6,000 to $8,000 a month from UGC. It takes around eight hours a week and can be more demanding than other income streams. I need to craft videos that convert well in sales, which takes extra brainpower.
<h2><b>5. Pet sitting</b></h2>
<h3><b>Easy rating: 10/10</b></h3>
<h3><b>Lucrative rating: 10/10</b></h3>
I got into pet sitting as a side gig while working in tech. I started on Rover, an app that links pet owners with sitters. Setting up a profile and passing a background check is quick, and you can start earning as soon as you’re booked.

It’s ideal for remote workers like me — getting paid to hang out with cute animals is great, and I can still manage other tasks, like checking up on my picnic business, answering emails, or creating content.

In January 2024, I was pet-sitting almost every day, and I enjoyed it because it was such a relaxing job. The only downside is I didn’t get to travel as much since I needed to stay with the pets.

It’s an extremely easy side hustle if you understand pet care and behavior. Pets are super easy to work with as long as they’re not puppies — puppies are more work.
<h2><b>6. Airbnb arbitrage</b></h2>
<h3><b>Easy rating: 2/10</b></h3>
<h3><b>Lucrative rating: 4/10</b></h3>
Airbnb arbitrage is my least favorite income stream — I may be letting go of this soon because the Airbnb market isn’t as hot as it used to be a few years ago.

How it works is I rent a property from a landlord for $1,700, for example, and once my business partner and I get the green light to use it as a short-term or mid-term rental, we list the property on platforms like Airbnb and VRBO. We’re tenants but act more like property managers, and we then earn profits from these listings.

After splitting earnings with my business partner, my net profit is around $600 per month. Since we focus primarily on mid-term stays, which require less frequent turnovers, my partner and I spend about five to six hours monthly on maintenance and cleaning, typically at the end of each stay.

It’s my least favorite side hustle because the financial risk is the highest — you have to accommodate guest needs, and the work is not enjoyable either. After monthly expenses, I don’t think the payout is enough to justify the effort.
<h2><b>7. Selling digital products</b></h2>
<h3><b>Easy rating: 10/10</b></h3>
<h3><b>Lucrative rating: 4/10</b></h3>
I created a content creation e-book because I’ve had many people on social media ask me to coach them. Whenever people ask me about content creation, I direct them to my link so they can buy my e-book.

I sell it for $20, and each month I make $60 to $80. I don’t promote it that much since I only have it as a resource for when people ask.

Anyone with enough knowledge about a specific topic can create an e-book or digital product, so it’s easy to do. However, it does take time and effort to bring in sales.
<h2><b>8. Nannying</b></h2>
<h3><b>Easy rating: 8/10</b></h3>
<h3><b>Lucrative rating: 9/10</b></h3>
I nanny for a family that flies me from Houston to New York three or four times a year. I stay for two to three weeks and get paid $1,200 a week.

My day-to-day is very simple — I take the girls to school in the morning, and when I come back, I can make content or go outside and explore the city. When the girls come home, I eat dinner, play with them, and then put them to sleep.

The families I babysit for in Houston and the family I nanny for in New York are all amazing to me and compensate me generously, which makes my job enjoyable and easy. The hardest part is when the kids are sick because I have to be more hands-on. Aside from that, once you become familiar with their routines, it’s super chill.
<h2><b>I wish I had diversified my income sooner</b></h2>
Although building my income streams took a lot of hustling upfront, I wish I had started sooner. I went from making $8/hour working a labor-intensive job as a ranch hand to now making over $100,000 a year from only working around 40 hours a month.

For those who are considering creating more income streams, don’t be reckless or stingy with your spending. Be courageous in investing in yourself, a business idea, or in others. If your dreams don’t scare you a little, they might not be big enough.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence is a technology that is becoming increasingly widespread and popular in various areas of our lives.

Smart algorithms can instantly solve problems that would take real people hours and even days to solve. One of the areas where AI is now playing a major role is finance, and, more specifically, Forex.

Applying machine learning algorithms to this market can significantly improve trading strategies and increase profits. This article discusses AI FOREX trading and how you can use it to your advantage.

&nbsp;
<h2><span id="What_Is_Forex_Trading" class="ez-toc-section"><b>What Is Forex Trading?</b></span></h2>
Forex is an international foreign exchange market where currencies of different countries are exchanged. In this market, banks, corporations, individuals, and other participants make money from the difference in rates.

If you can successfully predict the direction of the price curve, you will be able to enter the trade at the right time and make a profit. The market operates five days a week and is the largest and most liquid worldwide.

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240425120144im_/https://nopassiveincome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/forex.png" />
<h2><span id="What_is_AI_in_Forex_Trading" class="ez-toc-section"><b>What is AI in Forex Trading? </b></span></h2>
One of the main problems traders face is the inability to quickly analyze huge amounts of data. Of course, there are traditional methods of analysis, but they are all very labor-intensive and costly. Artificial intelligence can significantly speed up data processing, automate it, and improve forecasting accuracy.

This does not mean that AI-powered trading software is a source of free money. Technologies can identify hidden patterns and trends, quickly calculate indicators, correlate different inputs, and much more. However, they are just a tool in the hands of the trader. So, you can set the program to perform specified operations, such as buying or selling currencies and opening positions in real time.

Moreover, AI helps traders create more effective trading strategies. If you are not new to FOREX, you understand how important it is to choose the optimal combination of financial instruments, diversify your portfolio, and determine the volume of various assets in it.

Doing it yourself requires months of experience and many unnecessary mistakes. With AI, you can start trading after just a couple of days of familiarization and setup. So, what smart technologies can be used for trading?
<h2><span id="Why_Have_AI_Trading_Bots_Become_a_Game_Changer" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Why Have AI Trading Bots Become a Game Changer? </b></span></h2>
One of the main ways to use artificial intelligence in the Forex market is to connect trading bots (expert advisors) based on machine learning algorithms. They can analyze the market, predict its changes, and automatically make trades. At the same time, bots work around the clock (during all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240425120144/https://nopassiveincome.com/choosing-highest-paying-prop-trading-firms/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">trading</a> sessions), do not make impulsive decisions, and strictly comply with all risk management requirements.

The developers of such programs constantly update their software and make bots more and more efficient and autonomous. Although they cannot replace a trader 100%, they are quite capable of trading independently. Moreover, you are not limited in the number of bots and can test different algorithms to find the most effective one.

Can such programs make ineffective trades? Of course, they can, since the foreign exchange market is an unpredictable environment, and “black swans” may appear at any time. However, the number of failed trades is usually less than for experienced traders. And some providers offer compensation for lost funds.

In fact, trading programs have been around for a long time, but only in recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence, they have become a real game changer. Today, you don’t need to understand programming or make complex settings. The interface of popular platforms allows you to understand the bot as quickly as possible and immediately start trading. Subsequently, powerful AI technologies and round-the-clock monitoring make the bot’s solutions as profitable as possible.

&nbsp;
<h2><span id="Pros_and_Cons_of_Trading_Bots" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Pros and Cons of Trading Bots </b></span></h2>
If you plan to buy an advisor, stop and weigh the pros and cons. Using a bot has some undeniable advantages, but there are also risks. To make such an important decision as delegating your work to a program, you should look at the coin from both sides. Let’s start with the pros:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Making transactions 24/7 and analyzing the market situation around the clock.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">An analytics function: the bot gives you recommendations, and you make transactions yourself.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Some providers allow you to test the robot on a demo account.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Bots can be customized as much as possible. Even if you don’t find the settings you need in a certain program (which is unlikely, since the choice is huge today), you can order an assistant that is customized individually to suit your needs.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Programs are not subject to stress or emotions. They always make informed decisions based on market analysis and specified algorithms.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Today, the industry offers a huge variety of trading bots, so everyone can find the best option.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">There is no need to constantly be at the computer and monitor the market situation — work time is reduced and efficiency increases.</li>
</ul>
Now, to complete the picture, let’s look at what disadvantages machine trading algorithms have:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Positive results in the past do not guarantee the same successful performance in the future. Sometimes, reconfiguration may be required.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Constant use of trading bots can lead to a trader losing their trading skills.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Fine-tuning a trading advisor, especially when using complex custom strategies, may require programming skills or outsourcing of specialists.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">The bot requires continuous access to the Internet. Any interruptions could harm the trade balance.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Cheaper and non-updated advisors sometimes lose their effectiveness.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">A trading advisor cannot independently analyze news, rumors, market expectations, and any other information to which they are not connected.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span id="Conclusion" class="ez-toc-section"><b>Conclusion </b></span></h2>
When used skillfully, trading bots can bring significant income and even help train traders. At the same time, you should have a clear trading strategy and an understanding of the principles of the bot’s operation. You can set it up to automatically execute trades or use it as a market analysis tool.

Reputable software providers constantly monitor technological innovations in the field of AI and regularly implement machine learning algorithms in their products. At the same time, you do not need to have complex technical skills — the programs are created for traders and not for programmers. Their interface is clear, the settings are quite simple, and the conditions of use practically do not pose any risks.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nike is responding to criticism and allegations of sexism over the company’s uniforms for Team USA’s Track and Field athletes ahead of the 2024 Olympic Games.

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240415210133im_/https://sidebuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Nike-Responds-to-Criticism-Over-2024-Olympic-Uniforms.jpg" alt="Nike Responds to Criticism Over 2024 Olympic Uniforms" />

The Olympics take place in Paris this summer, beginning on July 26.

Images of the kit reveal one option for women is a high-cut, one-piece uniform. The men’s kit, however, seems to feature longer spandex shorts and a full-coverage tank top.

The outfits quickly garnered reactions from current and former athletes across the sport.

“Women’s kits should be in service to performance, mentally and physically. If this outfit was truly beneficial to physical performance, men would wear it,” former U.S. Champion runner Lauren Fleshman wrote in a lengthy Instagram post. “This is not an elite athletic kit for track and field. This is a costume born of patriarchal forces that are no longer welcome or needed to get eyes on women’s sports.”

Another former U.S. Olympian, Tara Davis-Woodhall, who is aiming to earn a spot in the 2024 games for Team USA, commented on an Instagram post by Citius Mag saying that her “hoo haa is gonna be out.

“This mannequin is standing still, and everything’s showing… imagine MID FLIGHT,” wrote US Paralympian Jaleen Roberts.

However, VP of apparel innovation at Nike, Janett Nichol, explained to CBS that the uniforms were made using technology at the Nike Sports Research Lab in Oregon to help create garments that would allow the athletes to perform at their optimum level.

“On the apparel side, why it’s a game-changer for us is because we’ve now been able to take athlete insights, along with data, and use that algorithm to create something that allows us to get to a level of specificity, fidelity, and accuracy that we’ve never been able to do before,” Nichol told the outlet.

Nike clarified via email to Reuters that female U.S. Track &amp; Field athletes were given the option to wear the unitard in a brief or short style and that the full set for both men and women includes upwards of 50 different pieces and 12 different styles depending on the specific event being participated in.

Nike did not immediately respond to Entrepreneur‘s request for comment.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Let’s face it — U.S. workers are burned out.

Research from <i>Aflac</i> on the stress levels of U.S.-based workers found that over 50% of respondents experienced burnout in 2023, and nearly 75% reported having moderate stress levels at work.

But organizational psychologist and bestselling author Adam Grant, a go-to expert for mindset and organizational habits, says that leaders in the workplace are to blame, not burned-out employees.

<img class="lazyload lazyload-simple et-lazy-loaded" role="presentation" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240424033031im_/https://assets.entrepreneur.com/images/misc/1713296409_GettyImages-1409734996.jpg?width=1000" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240424033031/https://assets.entrepreneur.com/images/misc/1713296409_GettyImages-1409734996.jpg?width=1000" /><sup><i>Adam Grant onstage during a panel at the 2022 Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit (Brian Stukes/Getty Images)</i></sup>

“I think about burnout as a sense of emotional exhaustion that’s both persistent and impairing, meaning it’s not just a blip — it sticks. It also interferes with your ability to function,” Grant told <i>Entrepreneur</i> at BetterUp’s Uplift conference last week. “It’s a structural and cultural problem if you have more than one person burning out. That is a challenge to tackle in your organization that leaders need to be responsible for.”

As the issue of burnout continues to plague employees and their employers, Grant, a Wharton professor, said the solution is to focus on what he calls the “demand, control, support” method of leadership that can help employees find meaning and motivation in their work — and tackle burnout in the process.

Grant broke down his strategy for us below<b> </b>using data from Return to Office Insights researched by BetterUp Labs.
<h2>Demand</h2>
Grant says leaders need to examine what the demands are that are causing burnout in the first place.

“That has to do with overload, that’s having too much work, it’s having work that doesn’t have clear expectations, it’s being expected to be on 24/7,” Grant says. “Those kinds of demands are taxing. We need to figure out if there are pockets of people who are burning out with similar kinds of work — that’s a sign to me that the demands are excessive.”

Reducing demands can mean anything from hiring more staff to delegating responsibilities, but the end goal should always be to make employee demands “more manageable.”
<h2>Control</h2>
But sometimes demands can’t be eliminated. For example, if you work at a startup and customers are placing orders from all around the world, eliminating hours might not work. Instead, Grant says companies can give employees more control over their day.

“What we can do is to try to give more choice and more freedom around how you manage those demands,” Grant explains. “We want to give people control over what they’re working on, when they do it, who they do it with how they get it done. And those sources of autonomy tend to make demands more manageable is the general finding.”<b></b>

Grant also said that today’s employees prefer controlling their office hours and want to have a more flexible work environment. Offering this control back to the employees could be effective in mitigating burnout.

“There’s been a lot of discussion about where we work as a form of flexibility. My read of the evidence is that people want discretion over when they work more than where they work,” Grant explained. “So if you give people the flexibility to set their own hours, they are very happy to come to the office, if that’s a tug of war.”
<h2>Support</h2>
Grant says “support” is about “giving people the tools that they need to cope with demands” in the workplace and making mental health a priority.

“It’s also about building a culture where [employees] feel that they can be candid about their emotional well-being and seek help if they need it,” he said.

But telling employees that you prioritize mental health and actually making them feel comfortable talking about it are two different things, he says.

The most effective way to combat this, he says, is when a leader sets an example and is open about needing to take time off for mental health reasons and fostering an open dialogue amongst employees when they’re struggling.

“I think modeling that makes it clear to people at all levels that this is not just lip service, we’re not just claiming that you can take care of yourself, we’re actually demonstrating through our own behavior that it’s acceptable and encouraged around here,” Grant says. “It’s been frustrating to watch a lot of companies say, alright, we have a burnout problem, we’re going to give you mindfulness training or we’re going to teach you stress management skills as if this is not a psychological problem.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There are many ways to generate passive income and change your financial future. Whether you want to earn just an extra $1000 per month on the side or go into something full-time and replace your current salary, different passive income ideas require different work and time.

Upfront work is required, so don’t expect to get rich overnight, but with a plan in place and the right kind of motivation, you can see success much sooner than you think.

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230907051508im_/https://sidebuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/10-Proven-Passive-Income-Ideas-for-2023.jpeg" alt="10 Proven Passive Income Ideas for 2023" />
<h2 id="3-passive-income-business-models">1. Start an Online Business</h2>
Starting an online business is the best way to generate revenue on autopilot.

Why?
<ol>
 	<li>You don’t need a ton of cash upfront.</li>
 	<li>You have a lot of room to make mistakes, and</li>
 	<li>It’s one of the most fulfilling life adventures you could ever be on.</li>
</ol>
I started my first online business in 2008 after being laid off from an architecture job I loved. My website helped architects pass a difficult exam, and people paid me for study material I created to help them prepare.

How much money did this business make?

In one year, I generated over $200,000, more than double what I earned as an architect.
<h2 id="1-affiliate-marketing">2. Affiliate Marketing</h2>
Affiliate marketing allows you to generate passive income simply by recommending existing products to other people. If you’ve ever recommended something to a friend, you know how to do affiliate marketing already.

Affiliate marketing has been my most significant single source of revenue, bringing in over $4 million since 2009.

So, how does affiliate marketing work, exactly?

With affiliate marketing, you recommend other people or company’s products and services to your following. You can talk about it on YouTube, a website, in an email, or even just with your social following. And, when someone purchases from your recommendation, you’ll receive a commission from the sale.

One of the most popular and accessible ways to get started is through the Amazon Affiliate Program. People already know and trust shopping from Amazon, and you’ll have a massive range of products to select from.

Just be sure only to choose products that you can stand behind, and that will serve your audience well, and be sure to always be upfront that a link you promote is an affiliate link.

To be successful with this, you’ll need to put time into building an audience who trusts that you’ll always steer them in the right direction and then follow through on that.
<h2 id="2-starting-a-youtube-channel">3. Start a YouTube Channel</h2>
Starting a YouTube channel is an excellent option for making passive income online; it’s free to get started, and if you create videos that people want to watch, you can generate revenue from ads, sponsorships, and even promoting your products.

Recently, I started a new YouTube channel all about Pokemon cards called Deep Pocket Monster. In two years, this new channel has grown to over 500,000 subscribers, and it generates revenue from ads, sponsorships, and even affiliate marketing by promoting card shops and binders on my videos.

<iframe title="The Smart Passive Income Online Business and Blogging Podcast - SPI 711: A Hidden Revenue Source for People who Have Clients with Chase Buckner" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230907051508if_/https://app.fusebox.fm/embed/player/track/J24xZAnWal/gid://art19-episode-locator/V0/xL0g0Bw6T2Zrs8eK8c_gURGHFfCpeftiLXaUFF3jdw4?uncontained" width="100%" height="160" frameborder="0" data-ruffle-polyfilled="" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe>
<h2 id="3-paid-membership-business">4. Open a Paid Membership Business</h2>
Like signing up for a gym membership, people join online memberships and pay recurring fees for the sense of community and value it brings them. In fact, we have a couple ourselves:
<ul>
 	<li>Our SPI All-Access Pass is a community of up-and-coming entrepreneurs who get access to all of our courses, workshops, community events, and even guides to help them through the material.</li>
 	<li>SPI PRO is our higher-level community of established business owners who want to network, connect, and share ideas with growth in mind. We require an application to get into this paid community.</li>
</ul>
Both of our communities require a recurring payment (quarterly or annual), but people are happy to continue to pay that because they’re getting more value in return.

With a membership business, you may need a platform to host your community. Circle is our top choice because it’s easy to use and familiar to users who join. This is our affiliate link for Circle in case you’d like to check it out and give it a run!
<h2 id="4-print-on-demand-designs">5. Make Print-on-Demand Designs</h2>
If you have a keen eye for design and current trends and know how to use design software, selling print-on-demand designs could be a great option to create passive income.

With print-on-demand, you don’t have to buy any inventory ahead of time, so it’s a low-risk business model.

You’ll work with a print provider, like Printful or Teespring, to sell merch (t-shirts, mugs, bags, etc.) customized with your designs and sold per order.

When someone buys one of your designs, the print provider fulfills, prints, and ships the order on your behalf.

The trickiest part is making unique, high-quality designs that inspire your people to purchase them.
<h2 id="5-software-as-a-service-saas-business">6. Offer Software as a Service (SaaS) Business</h2>
Another potentially lucrative option for passive income is to create an app or software that you can offer as a subscription service—also called software as a service (SaaS).

To do something like this requires coding knowledge or the funds to hire someone who knows how to code, but there are many resources available to find people who can do that kind of work for you, like Upwork.

Remember that this is one of the more time-consuming options; it will take a good chunk of time to plan and get things up and running.

Also, you will have to create and offer a truly valuable solution—and market your solution effectively—to make passive income with this, which isn’t exactly easy.

This is a challenging route., but it can be rewarding.
<h2 id="6-creating-an-online-course">7. Create an Online Course</h2>
Everyone has a skill they can teach, so why not monetize yours AND help others by creating an online course?

Making an online course isn’t too difficult either, but it will take a lot of time and effort to ensure it’s useful. We host our online courses on both Teachable and Circle, and it’s an amazing way to package information into a place where people can experience a transformation or solve a problem.

Once you’ve created the content and have everything set up, it can be an incredibly profitable source of passive income.

There are several platforms, like Udemy or Skillshare, that you can choose from to host your course and facilitate getting your course paid viewers.

However, I always recommend using your website to give you greater control and true ownership.
<h2 id="7-no-code-apps">8. Create No-Code Apps</h2>
Did you know you can reap the benefits of creating an app without knowing how to code? Apart from hiring an expensive developer, that is.

Yep, you can control the process and create an app through development platforms like Zapier, Appy Pie, or Bubble.

There are <i>a lot </i>of apps out there, so to be successful with this, you’ll need to search and identify a need and fill that need with your app.

If you set your objectives ahead of time and know exactly which problem you’re trying to solve—and who you’re solving it for—you’ll already be a step ahead of the competition.

With this, you can earn high passive income through downloads, subscriptions, ads, etc.—depending on how you model it.
<h2 id="8-publishing-an-ebook">9. Publish an eBook</h2>
Selling eBooks online is a very accessible method of making passive income.

The idea of creating a whole digital “book” might still sound intimidating to you, but I promise it’s actually simple to do.

Your book’s content can be informative or entertaining, and it can be as short and simple as a 5-page PDF.

You don’t have to be a pro writer or even an expert on your eBook’s topic. Just be sure to provide high-quality, well-designed content that resonates with your audience.

You can even hire a freelance ghostwriter and graphic designer to help you out.

All you have to do is self-publish it to Amazon or Apple Books and promote it to your audience.

Writing an eBook gives you a vehicle to benefit your existing audience with helpful information, further strengthening your relationship with them.

It’s also a great tool to augment your audience to new levels and boost traffic to your website, podcast, and other channels—growing your brand.
<h2 id="9-writing-a-book">10. Write a Book</h2>
Writing a physical book is a great way to generate passive income, not just from the book’s potential sales, but how it may promote other services and products you have to offer.

I’ve written and published three books myself, and although it’s a tough route, it’s super rewarding, and the residual income, if you continue to market the book (or it takes off on its own)can be plentiful.

My self-published book, <i>Will It Fly</i>, has generated a total of $459,341.00 (between 2016 and 2019)

If you’d like to join a community of people just like you who are building their businesses right now, please check out our All-Access Pass. We’ll guide you across our entire course library to ensure you give yourself the best chance to earn an additional income.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever been on a rollercoaster and felt your stomach drop as you plummeted down a steep incline? That feeling of exhilaration mixed with fear makes roller coasters so popular. But did you know that real estate investment can give you the same adrenaline rush?

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230502183040im_/https://sidebuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Why-Real-Estate-Investment-is-the-Ultimate-Adventure-for-Entrepreneurs.jpg" alt="Why Real Estate Investment is the Ultimate Adventure for Entrepreneurs" />

Investing in real estate can be a wild ride, full of ups and downs. It’s not for the faint of heart, but for those brave enough to take the leap, the rewards can be immense. Here are a few reasons why real estate investment is the ultimate adventure for entrepreneurs.
<h2>1. The thrill of the chase</h2>
Investing in a property can feel like a treasure hunt, where finding the right one requires extensive search and effort. To discover the perfect investment, one has to scour through numerous listings, visit multiple properties, and analyze the financial numbers. Despite the challenging and time-consuming process, the feeling of fulfillment upon finding the ideal property can be unparalleled.

The satisfaction of finding the right property can be hard to beat. However, it is essential to undertake thorough research and due diligence to ensure that the investment aligns with your goals and objectives. By carefully scrutinizing the property’s location, condition and potential for growth, you can make an informed decision and reap the benefits of a successful investment.
<h2>2. The high stakes</h2>
Investing in real estate is not a game for the faint-hearted. It requires a high tolerance for risk and an ability to handle the pressure of making large financial decisions. The potential rewards of real estate investing can be substantial, but so are the risks. A single wrong move can result in significant losses, leaving investors with nothing to show for their efforts.

However, the rewards can be significant for those willing to take the plunge. With the right strategy and approach, real estate investing can generate substantial wealth and provide a steady stream of passive income. Nevertheless, it’s crucial to approach real estate investing with caution and to be aware of the risks involved to make informed decisions that will lead to success.
<h2>3. The challenge</h2>
Investing in real estate can be a daunting task that demands a great deal of hard work, unwavering dedication and specialized knowledge. However, for entrepreneurs who seek out and relish challenging opportunities, there is no greater source of satisfaction than overcoming the hurdles and attaining success in a demanding and complex industry.

The world of real estate investment requires individuals to have a deep understanding of market trends, financial analysis, legal procedures and property management. It is a field where even a minor misstep can have significant financial consequences, and therefore, it demands high levels of attention to detail. Yet, for those willing to commit to this pursuit, the rewards can be substantial, and the sense of accomplishment that comes with achieving success in this field can be unparalleled.
<h2>4. The sense of control</h2>
Real estate investment provides a unique control level not found in other investment options. Unlike stocks or mutual funds, real estate investors have a say in how the property is managed and improved to maximize their returns. They can make decisions regarding renovations, tenant selection and rental rates, among other things. This level of control is particularly attractive to entrepreneurs who value autonomy and independence in their investment decisions.

With this level of control comes the potential for greater risk and responsibility, as managing a property requires more effort and time than passive investment options. However, for those willing to put in the work, real estate investment can be highly rewarding and profitable. It allows for a more hands-on approach to building wealth and can provide a sense of fulfillment for those who enjoy taking charge of their investments.
<h2>5. The potential for passive income</h2>
Real estate investment offers significant advantages, one of which is the potential for generating passive income. By investing wisely, you can reap a steady stream of income from your properties with minimal effort. This can grant entrepreneurs the financial independence to pursue their other interests and passions without being tied down by a traditional 9-to-5 job.

Through strategic real estate investments, investors can take advantage of various rental and lease opportunities to generate a consistent and reliable source of income. Such investments can provide financial stability and long-term wealth accumulation, making it an attractive option for those seeking financial freedom. Additionally, real estate investment can provide a hedge against inflation and offer tax benefits, further strengthening its potential as a source of passive income.
<h2>6. The sense of community</h2>
Real estate investment can also give you a sense of community. When you own a property, you become a part of the neighborhood. You have a stake in the community, and you can make a difference in the lives of the people there. This can be a powerful motivator for entrepreneurs who value social impact.

In conclusion, real estate investment can be the ultimate adventure for entrepreneurs. It’s a wild ride full of thrills and spills, but for those willing to take the risk, the rewards can be immense. So if you’re looking for a new challenge, why not consider investing in real estate? It just might be the ride of your life!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Your blog could be more than just a place to write down your thoughts and opinions or promote your brand; instead, you can use it as a tool to make passive income.

This means that you can set up ways to make money through your blog and then sit back and wait for the money to come in without having to put any work into the process.

Keep reading for a few ways that you can get started.

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20231206013951im_/https://sidebuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ways-to-Get-More-Passive-Income-from-Your-Blog.jpg" alt="active or passive income" />
<h2><span id="Write_and_Sell_an_E-Book" class="ez-toc-section">Write and Sell an E-Book</span></h2>
If you are already blogging, you are already confident in your abilities as a writer. And if you have a large enough following, you know that people respect you for what you have to say, for the knowledge that you can share with them, and for the valuable content that your blog provides.

So why not go a step further and write up a short e-book that you can then promote to your subscribers and readers for sale?

Whether you are a blogging expert on public health policy, thanks to your masters of public health from a reputable university, or you are known for your ability to teach others how to create art online with Adobe programs, all you have to do is put your e-book on your blog and wait for the sales to come in.

<h2><span id="Sell_Ad_Space_on_Your_Blog" class="ez-toc-section">Sell Ad Space on Your Blog</span></h2>
If you are able to prove that you get a lot of traffic to your blog on a consistent basis, you can start selling ad space to fellow businesses on your website.

This is one of the many popular methods that bloggers use to generate passive income, as you can simply place the ads within the headers and the margins of the site without them getting in the way of your content.

Just be sure to keep the ads to a minimum, display them in a tasteful way, and focus on getting ads from businesses that would appeal to your readers.

With NoPassiveIncome, I’m doing great with BuySellAds:

<h2><span id="Sign_Up_for_Affiliate_Marketing_Programs" class="ez-toc-section">Sign Up for Affiliate Marketing Programs</span></h2>
Finally, you can sign up for one of the many affiliate marketing programs that are available to bloggers and website owners just like you. These are really easy to sign up for and set up, and all you have to do is place ads for those companies on your website.

Depending upon the affiliate program that you sign up with, you can make money every time that a visitor clicks on one of the links, or when that person clicks through and makes a purchase.

You can also work on incorporating your affiliate offers in a tasteful way throughout your content so that more people are encouraged to click through, find out more, and make a purchase.

Just make sure the affiliates are related to your blog’s content so that readers will not be turned off by them.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The concept of passive income has been around forever. Since passive income does not have to be actively managed, it is much more scalable. This affords entrepreneurs even more time to pursue both active and passive income opportunities.

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240303103245im_/https://sidebuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Theres-No-Better-Time-to-Start-a-Passive-Income-Business.jpg" alt="There's No Better Time to Start a Passive Income Business than Now" />

I’ve started many of these businesses myself over the last decade, as well as helped others. With this experience in mind, I want to share important steps in preparing to participate in a passive income stream, and what to look out for ahead of time.
<h2>Grow your credit score</h2>
Foremost to building a passive income stream is having a good credit score. This opens many doors for extensive capital, which can be surprisingly cheap. Even if you have the funds sitting in liquid investments, borrowed capital is a better option. A good credit score allows you this capital, which is the lifeblood of any venture.

You should want to maximize leverage, too, never using your own capital when you can make a profit off of someone else’s debt capital. By leveraging debt capital with suitable terms and interest, you maximize your return on select investments while your capital remains intact.
<h2>Cultivate a network</h2>
It’s important to have intellectual resources around you. Picking the right passive income opportunity is not easy. If you have cultivated a network of entrepreneurs that you trust, you can discuss your options and get their intelligent feedback.

The bigger the network, the more valuable it is, so don’t be afraid to share your great ideas with those around you. You can even share your ideas with your broker, yet understand that they may be territorial and worried that you will divert capital away from them.
<h2>Find something proven, and be patient</h2>
Proven passive income streams are aplenty in e-commerce. There is no disputing the benefits, and efficiencies, of ordering online, especially with an increasingly remote workforce. This is one example, but the truth is that the Internet and its capacity for efficiency will spawn new passive income ideas for decades to come.

Before choosing an investment, do your homework and identify others who have been successful with that particular investment before you. Then, don’t expect to be immediately successful, just because they were. It may take a few months longer than you expected, to experience that same level of success. Impatient people rarely succeed as entrepreneurs, as they’re likely to bail out at the first roadblock. To succeed, you must sometimes put in meaningful work, and that often takes more time than you’d bargained for.
<h2>Be careful</h2>
Many people are selling passive income ideas, but with limited expertise behind them. These people are tantamount to used car salesmen. Do your due diligence to determine if experts are creating the engine behind the sales forces approaching you, and whether or not they will be accessible in some form or fashion as you pursue this new venture.

You should also attempt to identify whether or not the purveyor of a particular opportunity has deep pockets. If you burn through the initial capital and have nowhere else to turn to but a traditional bank, that will not be good. Banks have a limited understanding of passive income projects, so you are better off conferring with the purveyor beforehand to make sure that you’ll have access to reasonably priced capital in the unlikely event that you’ll need it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Working and collaborating remotely traveling the world, as well as being an extraordinary life experience, is also a real opportunity to be more productive, more motivated and more satisfied.

To testify it is a study entitled: The Future 100: Trends and Change to Watch in 2018, conducted by the famous American research agency J. Walter Thompson Intelligence.

For many it might be a surprise to know that, unlike the labels, most of the digital nomads are not made of young “under 30”, does not live constantly around the world with a backpack on his shoulders, is not composed only of singles and does not work exclusively as a freelancer.

In May 2016 (and already three years have passed), it was published the data from a survey conducted on a sample of over 500 digital nomads around the world that helps to disavow this belief.

In fact, this survey showed that only 29% of them are aged between 26 and 30, while 33% of digital nomads are over 30 (31-36 years old) and, surprisingly, 18% aged between 37 and 45, as well as a 5% aged between 45 and 70 years.

Most of the respondents (64%) also stated that they do not do freelance work, that they are not constantly traveling, but stay in a country for a long time (a few months) and always keep a “base” where they can do return.
<h2><span id="Why_Do_More_And_More_People_In_The_World_Choose_To_Become_Digital_Nomads" class="ez-toc-section">Why Do More And More People In The World Choose To Become Digital Nomads?</span></h2>
Working without space constraints means being able to choose the place to work from and at the same time, having the opportunity to make new experiences, learn new countries and cultures, experience new ways of living that make us feel freer and happier.

Not only. Working remotely from different places, as well as being an extraordinary experience of life, is also a real opportunity to return to being more productive and more satisfied with our work and our lifestyle.

You could find yourself living in extremely cold areas of North of Canada, where the temperature in some cities can reach the astonishing figure of -50 C. Just think that here people need to install a system like HeatLine.com to protect water pipes from freezing. Or, you can choose the sunny Florida, where you can experience warm temperatures all the year. If you think of moving there (even for a few months), consider that there are great movers in Bradenton.

Another advantage linked to the phenomenon of digital nomadism, is the possibility for companies that adopt “remote working” as a primary mode of work, to be able to access the best human resources and the best talent in the world regardless of the place or country in which they are found, without having to find them or have them available locally.

There are more and more “remote-friendly” companies in the world where everyone is free to work from the place he prefers.
<h2><span id="Why_Working_Remotely_Can_Increase_Your_Productivity" class="ez-toc-section">Why Working Remotely Can Increase Your Productivity?</span></h2>
Having the freedom to move elsewhere and to choose the world as an office can seem like a paradox for those who have always sought happiness in permanence, security and stability in the permanent job and have always considered the office as the workplace ideal!

The truth is that beyond the usual clichés about flexibility and the fact that the fixed and guaranteed place no longer exists, is the very idea of working for a lifetime sitting behind the same desk, or in the same company, to not be more current and not even what most people aspire to today.

The truth is that many people feel more and more urgent the need to free themselves from the rigidity and the constraints imposed by traditional work, the obligation of a fixed physicality, pre-established schedules and obligations of presence.

Young people, in particular, feel a strong inner drive towards the realization of personal projects, they feel the need to test themselves, to make international experiences, to grow personally and professionally, to know new realities and to connect with other people.

Remote work has strengthened this trend, because working remotely does not mean just working from home, but it means being able to work from anywhere.

<strong>So, why working remotely as a digital nomad, as well as a wonderful life experience, can help us to return to being more productive and more satisfied with our work?</strong>
<h2><span id="1_Freedom" class="ez-toc-section">1. Freedom</span></h2>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240129110825im_/https://nopassiveincome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/freedom.jpg" />

The main motivation that today pushes more and more people to free themselves from the constraints of a traditional job and to work remotely, is first of all the desire to feel freer.

Free to organize their lives, free to express their talent, free to choose the place and time to devote to work, modeling them according to their ideal lifestyle and their needs.

This means that for many, freedom is an important value.

<strong>To be fully satisfied and to give your best, you should live and act always aligned with your guiding values. If freedom is an important value, you should have experiences that make you feel truly free to get out of the routine that threatens to suffocate what you are and what you would like to be.</strong>

Always living in the same place, working closed for 8-10 hours a day in the same place, whether at home or in the office, in this case, does not make much difference, it is certainly not the best way to feed your need for freedom.

On the contrary: moving through different places, traveling inside and outside our physical and mental boundaries, taking time during the day to meet your personal needs, confronting different cultures, developing new enabling relationships in places that facilitate this process, is the best way to feel free.

Fulfilling your need for freedom will greatly increase your self-esteem and this will make you feel more confident and better at what you do.
<h2><span id="2_Happiness" class="ez-toc-section">2. Happiness</span></h2>
There is a clear and clear connection between happiness and productivity.

It is proven that positive emotions can increase the quality and quantity of productivity at work.

When you talk about happiness at work, there are many different aspects that must be taken into consideration. One of the places and spaces where to work is undoubtedly one of these.

The truth is that to increase your productivity and to live better, you should always work in those places where you feel happier.

Remote work gives you the opportunity to work anywhere. The house, the coworking space, the sea, the mountains, the countryside, the city, these happy places are not static but are changing according to the cycle you are experiencing.

Being in the right place at the right time means knowing how to listen to what you need at that moment to feel comfortable, in harmony with yourselves and with the context that surrounds you. In this case, nature and the ecosystem in which you dive can be a great resource, if used in the right way.

Think for a moment about the places where you felt particularly good in the past. This will start to give you an idea of ​​what the places could be working better and be happier and more productive.

Creativity is a skill that you can no longer do without today.

The current world of work needs professional figures who are able to combine creative thinking and technology, in different but increasingly interconnected sectors.

In January 2016, the World Economic Forum published a report entitled “The Future of Jobs and Skills” presenting the skills that, from now until 2020, will become indispensable in the world of work.

In the first three places, you can find: complex problem solving (ability to act autonomously to solve problems), critical thinking and creativity.

Psychologists and neuroscientists have shown that moving through different places, traveling, interacting with new people and new cultures is an enabling step to develop new ideas, nourish our creativity and develop critical thinking.

The reason is simple: creativity is connected with neuroplasticity, or with the ability of our brain to change. Neural pathways are influenced by the environment and habits, which means that they are also sensitive to change.

New landscapes, new sounds, smells, languages, tastes, new sensations and points of view, trigger different synapses in your brain and have the ability to revitalize your mind. Creativity only improves through immersion, involvement and adaptation to new experiences.

These are the three main reasons to work remotely, moving through different places can help you to be more productive and more satisfied with your work and your lifestyle.

But there is another important aspect that you must necessarily take into account because this is part of the needs of every human being and is the need to create constructive and enabling relationships,

Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new paradigm that allows you to feel at home in different places, to do all this in a simple way, activating the power of the relationship as the engine of everything.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[However, not every blogger can generate a good income from affiliate commissions.

I tell you more, with almost 2 billion websites out there (source “internet live stats“), many will not even be able to generate a single sale.

But let’s look at the glass as half full.

Indeed, many bloggers have taken affiliate marketing a step further and have devoted their entire professional lives to working online.

I’m sure it’s the dream of many of you.

<strong>But what turns a good affiliate into a <em>great </em>affiliate?</strong>

In truth, there is no easy answer, as the range of potential products and services that can be promoted through affiliate marketing means that there has been an equally diverse range of practices and methods used to exploit it.

If you’re completely in the dark about this whole affiliate marketing, though, let me fill you in.

You need to consider some points when choosing the path of making money online with affiliate marketing (this post contains circa 1500 words and takes around 7 minutes to read).

&nbsp;
<h2><span id="What_is_Affiliate_Marketing_and_How_Does_It_Work" class="ez-toc-section">What is Affiliate Marketing and How Does It Work?</span></h2>
It’s a relatively modern form of marketing with its roots in the early nineties when companies would hire members of the general public to direct people to their stores.

The reasoning is that people are more likely to trust ‘one of their own than a company drone.

The affiliate marketing of today is essentially the same practice, only online.

Essentially everything boils down to uploading links that direct your viewers to your affiliate partner’s site.

If some of them are going to purchase that product or service, you’ll get a commission out of it.

Generally, the standard is 10-20%, but the commission can be up to 50% or even 70% for specific products.

So basically, the commission amount can fluctuate from as low as $1 up to greater sums, like $1.000, $2.000, or even $10.000, depending on what product or service you are recommending.
<div class="content-box-blue">With this regard, check this post:
4-Step Plan You Need to Make $2,000/Month with High-Ticket Offers</div>
Now, when you register for affiliate programs, you will get a unique affiliate link that you will use when promoting that specific product.

This is a tracking URL, which companies (or affiliate networks) use to record if your referral generated the sale.

Every affiliate program you are going to register to has its own terms of service, like, for example, the cookie period.

If this time is set to 30 days, if your visitor uses your affiliate link to check a product web page but decides to buy it within the next 30 days, you will still receive the affiliate commission.

Here are some important affiliate marketing terms you should read about.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Affiliates:</strong> people (webmasters, bloggers) who will use affiliate programs to generate income.</li>
 	<li><strong>Affiliate Marketplace:</strong> You can sign in to find different affiliate programs in a specific niche (for example, ShareASale, ClickBank, Amazon, etc.).</li>
 	<li><strong>Affiliate Link:</strong> the unique tracking link you will receive when signing up for an affiliate program.</li>
 	<li><strong>Commission:</strong> it’s the amount of money you will get for each sale of the specific product or service you promote. Basically, if you recommend registering to an affiliate program and some of your readers will do, you will get a percentage of the commissions this user will generate (for a certain amount of time – generally one year). Some examples? SeedingUp, ValuedVoice.</li>
</ol>
The above-mentioned are just the basic terms you need to know to start your journey in affiliate marketing.

Soon, you will learn about coupons code, URL shorteners, landing pages, and so on.
<h2><span id="Study_and_Research" class="ez-toc-section">Study and Research</span></h2>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230929180441im_/https://nopassiveincome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/website.png" />

Getting the right information is crucial for affiliate marketing, like any other online business.

First of all, it’s about learning SEO and copywriting. Select a niche, make keyword research, target specific terms and write relevant, useful, informing content for your users.

There are tons of courses available on the internet and you should make your research before choosing one. I suggest this one, hosted by The Second Wallet and presented by Vick Strizheus, 8-figure internet entrepreneur and digital consultant.
<h2><span id="Choose_the_Right_Partners" class="ez-toc-section">Choose the Right Partners</span></h2>
Obviously, if your blog adheres to a specific niche, you’ll want to use partners whose products reflect that market.

For example, if you’re running a blog that deals with health and fitness, you should be looking for affiliates that deal with products such as health supplements and gym equipment and services such as personal training. <span data-contrast="none">Maybe you even love skincare and have a routine you want to share with millions of people. Direct sales for organic skincare companies have been increasing recently with the trends toward organic healthcare products. If you already know about skincare, then it makes selling much easier. </span>

<span data-contrast="none">If your blog is less focused, of course, you’ll have potential options, but it’s always best to have a clear, defined focus.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span>

Also, try not to focus on affiliates that only sell small ticket (inexpensive) items and services.

For bloggers who write about WordPress or websites creation, the BlueHost affiliate program gives a $60 commission for each sale.

And when you receive an email in your inbox announcing that you made a sale, you can party!
<h2><span id="Find_a_Balance" class="ez-toc-section">Find a Balance</span></h2>
As a blogger, affiliate marketing can potentially create an enormous amount of revenue for you and whomever it is you’re partnering with. Still, if you’re too heavy-handed with it, your blog could lose its credibility.

As your blog loses credibility, it will lose viewers, and that will send it spiraling down the search engine results ranking, leading your partners feeling like they’ve backed a lame horse.

Be sure to keep your blog stocked with content that isn’t affiliate marketing based, or people will soon see through you, and you’ll lose not only your blog but also any potential revenue you could earn through it.

If your content is not worth reading, then nobody will read it; it really is that simple.

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230929180441im_/https://nopassiveincome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/affiliate-marketing-1024x754.jpg" alt="affiliate marketing circle" />
<h2><span id="Research_Affiliate_Companies" class="ez-toc-section">Research Affiliate Companies</span></h2>
Unfortunately, as an affiliate, there’s very little chance you’ll be going it alone.

If you really want to make a decent amount of revenue, you’ll need to use an affiliate program.

The company that runs the program will be the ones paying you, so make sure that you do as much research as possible into the companies rates compared to their competitors and ask around to see if the company you’re considering has a good track record with their users.

Most affiliate programs will operate on a ‘pay per click’ or ‘pay per sale’ basis.

With PPC, you’ll get a commission for every person who visits your site and is referred to your affiliate partners’ site through your links. With PPS, you’ll only get your commission if the visitor eventually purchases an item or service from your partner’s site.

Obviously, you’ll generally gain more commission from a PPS system, but the commission will be far more infrequent.

Whether you decide you prefer PPC or PPS depends very much on your own personal preferences but make sure that the company you choose to work for uses the payment arrangement you’re most comfortable with.
<h2><span id="Produce_HIGH-QUALITY_Content" class="ez-toc-section">Produce HIGH-QUALITY Content</span></h2>
Do you know your audience?

Be sure to promote just those specific products or services relevant to your users and strive to create content that solves their problems or needs.

This is a good article from MarketingLand, that explains 7 big mistakes that new affiliate marketers make.

The first <strong>mistake is “Selling rather than helping.”</strong>

Be sure to write genuine posts to help your audience solving one of their needs or issues, and you will be right on your way to finally generate an income with affiliate marketing.
<h2><span id="Use_the_Right_Tools" class="ez-toc-section">Use the Right Tools</span></h2>
When it comes to affiliate marketing, like any other task online, if you are going to use the right tools, everything becomes much simpler.

First of all, you want to have a blog.
<div class="content-box-blue">

</div>
If you use WordPress, I have a tool to suggest to you.

It’s called the Pretty Links plugin, which will make your affiliate marketing work much easier.

Basically, it helps manage all your affiliate links under one dashboard, making it easy to add them every time you create new content.

Also, you can create groups for your links, cloak, and customize them.
<h3><span id="Conclusion" class="ez-toc-section">Conclusion</span></h3>
I hope this small guide to affiliate marketing is going to help you to get started.

There are many possibilities to earn money on the web. Most of them have in common that you need high-quality content. In fact, check these residual income business opportunities.

To generate truly high-class journalistic content, education is the best way. Open School of Journalism offers a distance education program in journalism with many electives, including online journalism, content marketing, etc.

And you, are you making money with affiliate marketing?

Do you have any other suggestions to add?

<h2>&quot;Can Students Score $30+/Hr Gigs?&quot;</h2>
<h3>Unlock High - Paying Side Gigs for College Students</h3>
<p>I know exactly how you feel, college students. Just like I was back in my college days, you're probably juggling a heavy course load and constantly short on cash. (It's really frustrating when you see all those opportunities pass by because you can't afford them.) But what if I told you there are quick side gigs that can pay you $30+/hour?</p>
<p>Take Buffer's case study as an example. A college student named Emily was struggling to make ends meet with her minimum - wage job at a local coffee shop. She decided to take up graphic design gigs on the side. In just three months, she built a portfolio and started landing projects that paid her an average of $35 per hour. By the end of the semester, she had earned an extra $2,500, which not only covered her textbook expenses but also allowed her to join her friends on a weekend getaway.</p>
<p>Here are some practical steps to get you started on these high - paying side gigs:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify Your Skills</strong>: Sit down for about an hour and list all your skills, whether it's writing, coding, or playing a musical instrument. You'd be surprised at how many marketable skills you already possess. For instance, if you're good at writing, you can offer freelance writing services.</li>
<li><strong>Build an Online Presence</strong>: Spend around two to three hours creating a simple website or a profile on freelancing platforms like Upwork or Fiverr. Share your portfolio, testimonials (if any), and a brief description of your services. This will help potential clients find you easily.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you can start turning your skills into a lucrative side income, just like Emily did. So, don't let financial stress hold you back from enjoying your college years!

<h2>&quot;Struggling? Here's How to Solve!&quot;</h2>
<h3>Common Challenges and Solutions</h3>
<p>So, you've probably found yourself in a bind just like I did during my college days. The struggle of paying for all your college - related expenses while trying to maintain a social life is real! It's a situation that countless college students face every day. </p>
<p>Let's look at a real - world example from Search Engine Journal. A student named Jake was drowning in debt. He had $500 in monthly tuition fees, $200 for textbooks, and another $300 for living expenses. That's a whopping $1000 a month! On top of that, his part - time job at a local coffee shop only brought in $300. He was constantly stressed about making ends meet (it's that sinking feeling in your stomach when you realize you can't afford to go out with friends). </p>
<p>But Jake didn't give up. He implemented some great solutions. First, he signed up for online surveys. In just two hours a week, he was able to earn an extra $50. That may not seem like much at first, but over a month, it added up to $200! Second, he started tutoring fellow students in subjects he excelled in. For two hours of tutoring each week, he charged $25 per hour, bringing in another $200 monthly. </p>
<p>Here are some actionable steps for you. First, look into online gigs. Websites like Upwork or Fiverr have quick tasks that you can complete in your free time. Spend just three hours a week, and you could start earning an extra $150 - $200 a month. Second, explore campus job opportunities. Many universities offer on - campus jobs with flexible hours and better pay. Apply to a few of these jobs within a week, and you might land one that can provide additional benefits like free meals or study materials. These steps can help you ease the financial burden and enjoy your college life more.</p>

<h2>&quot;Unveil Expert Tips: Best Practices?&quot;</h2>
<p>Now that we've talked about the financial struggles of college life, let's dive into some expert tips and best practices to help you earn some side cash. You know, many students find themselves in a tight spot, just like I did, constantly worrying about making ends meet.</p>
<p>According to the Content Marketing Institute, 65% of students who started freelance writing on the side were able to pay off at least 30% of their monthly expenses within six months. Take Sarah, a college junior majoring in English. She was struggling to afford new textbooks and even basic groceries. She decided to start offering her writing services on freelance platforms. At first, she charged a modest $15 per article. As she gained more experience and positive reviews, she was able to increase her rates to $30 per article. In just three months, she was making an extra $500 a month! (Imagine the relief of not having to stress about money every day.)</p>
<p>Here are some practical steps you can take:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify your skills</strong>: Take a weekend (about 2 - 3 hours) to sit down and list all your skills. Whether it's graphic design, coding, or tutoring in a particular subject, there's a market for it. This will help you figure out what side jobs you can pursue.</li>
<li><strong>Build an online presence</strong>: Over the course of a week, create a simple portfolio or profile on relevant platforms. For example, if you're into writing, set up a blog or an account on a freelance writing site. This will make it easier for potential clients to find you.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you can start earning some extra cash and ease the financial burden of college life.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I totally get it, college life is a financial tightrope, and I've been right where you are. Those side gigs I shared can be game - changers. They're quick to start and can pay you over $30 an hour, giving you the financial freedom I craved back in my college days.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I remember back in my college days, constantly eyeing that cool new gadget in the store window but having zero cash to spare. I was drowning in textbooks and assignments, and the thought of getting a regular job seemed like an impossible dream. Between lectures, labs, and group projects, there just wasn't enough time. It was so frustrating (feeling like I was missing out on life's little joys)!</p>
<p>If you're a student like I was, you're probably nodding along right now. You've got bills piling up, or you just want some extra cash for fun, but your class schedule is a beast. The pain of having limited funds while trying to focus on your studies is all too real. </p>

<h2>&quot;Can You Earn While in Class?&quot;</h2>
<p>So, you've been in the trenches of student life, just like I was, drowning in a sea of assignments with the weight of financial stress on your shoulders. It feels like a never - ending battle, but what if I told you there are ways to make money without sacrificing your study time? </p>
<p>Neil Patel once shared a case study of a college student named Sarah. Sarah was majoring in marketing and was swamped with classes. But she found a way to monetize her skills. She started a blog where she reviewed local restaurants. In just six months, her blog gained over 10,000 monthly visitors. By partnering with a few of the restaurants she reviewed, she made an extra $500 a month. This shows that with the right approach, students can indeed earn while studying.</p>
<p>Here are some actionable steps to get you started. First, freelance online. You can offer services like writing, graphic design, or programming on platforms like Upwork. Dedicate just 2 - 3 hours a week (ideally on weekends) to bid on projects. In about a month, you can start landing small gigs that could bring in an extra $100 - $200 a month. Second, become a tutor. If you're great at a particular subject, reach out to local schools or post ads on campus. Spend an hour or two each week tutoring students. In a couple of weeks, you could build a steady client base and start earning around $20 - $30 per session. </p>

This real - world example shows that with a bit of determination and the right approach, making money while studying is entirely possible.</p>
<p>Here are some practical solutions for you. First, consider freelance writing. It's a flexible gig that you can do in your free time. All you need is a computer and a good grasp of the language. Set aside 2 - 3 hours a day, and you can start pitching to blogs or websites. You could start earning anywhere from $10 - $50 per article depending on the complexity and client. Second, become a campus ambassador for a brand. This usually involves promoting products or services on campus. It might take you about 5 hours a week to attend events and spread the word, and you can earn around $200 - $300 a month.</p>
<p>These ways not only help you make some much - needed money but also give you valuable skills and experiences. So, don't let the lack of funds hold you back from enjoying your college years. Take action today and start exploring these class - friendly ways to make money!</p>
<h2>&quot;Conquering Common Challenges? Here's How!&quot;</h2>
<h3>Common Challenges and Solutions</h3>
<p>You know, just like I was stuck in that college bind with no money and too little time, many students today face similar uphill battles. One of the most common challenges is managing finances while juggling a busy academic schedule. It's like trying to ride a unicycle on a tightrope – one wrong move and you could end up in a financial free - fall.</p>
<p>Let's look at a real - world example from SEMrush. A student named Emily was in a similar fix. She had a part - time job but still couldn't make ends meet. She was spending an average of $300 a month on food delivery because she was too busy with classes and projects to cook. Using SEMrush, she analyzed her spending patterns and found that by switching to meal prepping, she could cut her monthly food expenses by 50%. This allowed her to save an extra $150 per month. (Imagine the relief of seeing your savings grow and feeling more in control of your finances!)</p>
<p>Now, here are some practical solutions. First, set a strict budget. Sit down for about 2 hours this weekend and list all your income sources and expenses. Categorize them as essential and non - essential. This will give you a clear picture of where your money is going. Second, explore online gig economy jobs. You can spend 1 - 2 hours a day during the week working on tasks like data entry, content writing, or graphic design. These jobs offer flexible hours, so you can work around your classes. Finally, look for student discounts. Spend 30 minutes each month researching local stores, restaurants, and online services that offer student - only deals. This way, you can save money on everyday purchases while still enjoying the things you like. </p>
<p>By implementing these tips and ways, you can overcome the financial challenges you face while focusing on your studies, just like Emily did.</p>

I totally get it, because I've been in your shoes, and it's a tough spot to be in (feeling like you're constantly on the edge of financial stress)!</p>
<p>Search Engine Journal once featured a case study of a college student named Alex. Alex was in a similar boat, swamped with studies and short on cash. They decided to take control of their situation. Alex started by tracking every single expense for a month. They found that they were spending around $150 a month on coffee from cafes.

Set aside just 30 minutes this weekend to sit down and list all your income sources (like part - time job earnings or allowances) and your expenses. This will give you a clear picture of where your money is going. Second, look for ways to earn extra money. You could take up online tutoring, which can be done in your free time.

Just like Alex, you can take charge of your money and enjoy the college experience without constantly worrying about bills. So, get started today and take control of your financial future!</p>

<p>Hey there, fellow busy students! I totally get it. Just like I was back in college, swamped with classes, assignments, and extracurriculars, you're probably desperate for some extra cash but short on time for a traditional part - time job. It's that frustrating cycle of being broke and busy that we all want to break free from. Well, I've got a guide for you on 12 passive income ideas that are super easy to set up.</p>
<p>Let's look at a real - world example from Buffer. There was a student who was juggling a full - time course load and still managed to create a passive income stream by starting an online e - book business. They spent about 20 hours in the first month researching and writing an e - book on a popular college - related topic. After publishing it on Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, they started earning a small but consistent income. In the first three months, they made around $500, and as time went on and they published more e - books, their monthly income reached $1500. </p>
<p>Now, let's get into some actionable steps. First, pick an idea that suits your skills and interests. If you're good at writing, like our Buffer example, focus on e - books or blog posts. This might take you about 2 - 3 hours to brainstorm and decide. Second, set up your income stream. For an e - book, you'll need to write, format, and publish it. This could take 10 - 20 hours in total. The benefits of these passive income ideas are huge. You can have extra money for textbooks, food, or just some fun on the weekend, all while not sacrificing your precious study time. So, don't wait any longer and start exploring these 12 easy - setup passive income ideas today!</p>
<h2>&quot;Can Students Easily Score Passive Income?&quot;</h2>
<p>Hey there, busy students! You're likely juggling classes, assignments, and maybe even some extracurriculars, just like I was back in my college days. I remember feeling constantly swamped and desperate for extra cash, but the thought of a traditional part - time job just added to my stress (it was such a frustrating situation!). If you're in the same boat, passive income is your saving grace.</p>
<p>Backlinko shares an inspiring case study. A student decided to start an online e - book business. They spent about 3 months researching, writing, and formatting an e - book on a popular college - related topic. After publishing it on Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, they started making around $500 per month within the first 6 months, with minimal ongoing effort. This shows that with a bit of initial work, passive income can become a reality.</p>
<p>Now, let's get into some practical steps to set up your own passive income streams. First, consider affiliate marketing. All you need to do is find a niche you're interested in, like tech gadgets or study resources. Sign up for affiliate programs related to that niche. It might take you about 2 - 3 hours to research and sign up for these programs. Then, create content on a blog or social media promoting the products. This could take an additional 5 - 10 hours per month. Second, start a YouTube channel. Choose a topic you're passionate about, like makeup tutorials or study tips. Filming and editing your first few videos might take 10 - 15 hours, but once you build an audience, ads on your videos can start bringing in income.</p>

<p>You're knee - deep in assignments and lectures, and the thought of making extra money seems like a far - off dream. But here's the good news: passive income is a game - changer for busy students! It's all about setting up income streams that don't require your constant attention, giving you more time for your studies.</p>
<p>Take the case of a student named Sarah from Moz. She was drowning in student debt and had no time for a part - time job. So, she decided to start an online ebook business. Sarah spent about 20 hours in the first month researching and writing a short ebook on a popular college - related topic. Once she published it on Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, it started generating sales. Within six months, her ebook had made over $1,500 in passive income. This shows that with a bit of initial effort, students can set up a successful passive income source.</p>
<p>Here are some practical steps to get you started:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start a blog</strong>: Choose a niche you're passionate about, like campus life or study tips. Spend 10 - 15 hours in the first week setting up your blog using platforms like WordPress (it's easier than you think!). Once it's up, write one high - quality post per week. Over time, you can monetize it through ads or sponsored posts.</li>
<li><strong>Affiliate marketing</strong>: Sign up for affiliate programs related to products you use. For example, if you're into tech gadgets, join Amazon Associates. Spend an hour researching products and creating simple reviews on your blog or social media. Each time someone buys through your link, you earn a commission.</li>
</ol>
<p>The benefits of these easy - setup passive income ideas are huge. You'll have extra money to pay for your expenses, and you can build valuable skills in marketing, writing, and business. It's like killing two birds with one stone! (Imagine how great it would feel to have a little extra cash in your pocket without sacrificing your study time.) So, don't let your busy schedule hold you back. Dive into these passive income ideas today!</p>
<h2>&quot;Can You Overcome These Challenges?&quot;</h2>
<h3>Common Challenges and Solutions</h3>
<p>Hey there! So, let's dive right into the common challenges and how we can turn them into opportunities. You know, just like I faced in my college days, being strapped for cash while juggling a million things. It's a story that many busy students can relate to, and the struggle is real (it's so disheartening when you can't even afford a decent meal).</p>
<p>Backlinko did an interesting study that showed how a student managed to set up a passive income stream. This student was in a similar bind, drowning in coursework and needing money. They decided to start an online store selling digital prints. By investing about 10 hours in the initial setup (finding designs, setting up the e - commerce platform), they were able to generate an extra $500 a month within three months. This real - world example proves that with a bit of effort, it's possible to break the cycle of being broke and busy.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about some practical solutions. First, consider starting a blog. It's an easy way to create a passive income source. All you need to do is pick a niche you're passionate about, write high - quality content, and monetize it through ads or affiliate marketing. You can spend about 5 hours a week writing and promoting your blog posts, and within six months, you might start seeing some decent earnings. </p>
<p>Another option is to sell stock photography online. If you're into photography, this is a great way to make money. Spend around 3 hours a week taking and editing photos, and then upload them to stock photo websites. Over time, you'll build a portfolio that can bring in a steady stream of passive income. So, don't let those challenges hold you back. Take action and turn your situation around!</p>

Then, they spent two weeks creating a simple website and social media profiles to promote their services. By leveraging their network and word - of - mouth, they quickly got their first clients. (Can you imagine the relief of having that extra cash flow in the middle of a tight budget?)</p>
<p>So, here are some practical steps you can take. First, assess your skills. Spend about an hour making a list of your academic strengths, hobbies, or any unique talents. This will help you figure out what services or products you can offer. Second, set up an online presence. Dedicate a weekend to creating a basic website or a profile on freelancing platforms. This will be your virtual storefront to attract potential clients. And third, start small. Begin by offering your services to friends, family, or classmates. It might take a month or two to build up a client base, but once you do, the income can start rolling in. These tips can help you break free from that cycle of being broke and busy, just like that student in the Backlinko case study did.</p>

That's why I've shared these 12 easy - setup passive income ideas with you. You've got options like selling stock photos, renting out your old textbooks, or starting a niche blog. These ideas can fit into your busy schedule and start bringing in some extra cash.</p>
<p>(Imagine finally having the freedom to buy those textbooks without stress or going out for a nice meal with friends without worrying about money.) It's time to stop being stuck in that cycle of being broke and busy. Don't let your lack of time hold you back from financial stability. Start implementing these passive income ideas today. Take that first step, and watch as your financial situation begins to improve. You've got this!</p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Are these passive income ideas really easy to set up?</h3>
<p>Yes, they are! Just like I was swamped with college tasks and still needed extra cash, these ideas are designed for busy students. For example, starting an online store on platforms like Etsy is straightforward. You can create digital products in your free time and list them with just a few clicks. Similarly, affiliate marketing can be set up by signing up for affiliate programs and sharing links on your social media, which doesn't take much time.</p>
<h3>How much money can I realistically make from these passive income ideas?</h3>
<p>The earnings vary depending on the idea you choose and the effort you put in. Some ideas like selling stock photos might bring in a small but steady stream of income. If your photos are high - quality and in demand, you could make a few dollars per download. On the other hand, a successful blog with affiliate marketing might generate more significant income over time as your readership grows. It's not a get - rich - quick scheme, but with consistency, you can cover some of your expenses like textbooks or food.</p>
<h3>Do I need any special skills for these passive income ideas?</h3>
<p>Not necessarily. For ideas like renting out your unused items, all you need is some items to rent and a platform to list them on. Even for content - based ideas like starting a YouTube channel, you don't need to be a professional filmmaker. You can start with simple videos using your phone and gradually improve your skills. Some basic knowledge of your chosen area can be helpful, but most of these ideas are beginner - friendly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I remember back when I was a student, constantly short on cash. I had all these dreams and plans, but my empty wallet was holding me back. I spent hours poring over job listings, only to find most required years of experience I didn't have. It was incredibly frustrating (feeling like my financial goals were slipping through my fingers). </p>
<p>If you're a student in the same boat, I get it. You're juggling classes, assignments, and maybe even extracurricular activities. The last thing you need is a low - paying job that eats up all your time. The pain points are clear: you need money to cover your expenses, but you don't have the experience that traditional jobs demand. </p>
<p>In this blog post, I've got great news for you. I'll be sharing 15 high - paying online jobs that are perfect for students like us. These jobs don't require any prior experience, allowing you to earn good money while focusing on your studies. Let's turn your financial situation around!
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1499750310107-5fef28a66643" alt="15 High-Paying Online Jobs Perfect for Students With No Experience" /></p>
<h2>&quot;15 High - Paying Online Jobs for Newbies?&quot;</h2>
<p>You've probably been there - in the student grind, low on funds and high on dreams, but those pesky experience requirements keep blocking your path to a well - paying job. Well, don't lose hope! There are 15 high - paying online jobs that are perfect for students with no experience.</p>
<p>Let's take a real - world example from Neil Patel. A college student named Emily was struggling to pay for her textbooks and living expenses. She decided to try her hand at online transcription. With no prior experience, she started small, spending about 2 hours a day on basic transcription gigs. In the first month, she earned around $200. As she got better at it, her speed and accuracy improved. By the third month, she was working around 3 hours a day and her monthly earnings had shot up to $600. </p>
<p>Here are some actionable steps to get you started:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Choose Your Niche (This is like picking the right tool for the job!)</strong>: Spend a weekend (about 8 - 10 hours) researching the 15 high - paying online jobs. Look at what skills are involved, the time commitment, and the earning potential. For example, if you're good at writing, content writing or copywriting could be great options. </li>
<li><strong>Build Your Portfolio</strong>: Depending on the job, this could take 1 - 2 weeks. For writing jobs, create some sample articles. For graphic design, put together a collection of your designs. You can use free online platforms to showcase your work. </li>
</ol>
<p>These tips and expert advice can set you on the path to earning well online, even without experience. It's time to turn your student days from cash - strapped to cash - confident!

<h2>&quot;Can Students Land High - Pay Online Jobs?&quot;</h2>
<p>So, you're probably thinking, &quot;How on earth can I land a high - paying online job with no experience as a student?&quot; Well, I've been in your shoes. I remember back when I was a student, constantly short on cash. I had all these dreams and plans, but my empty wallet was holding me back. I spent hours poring over job listings, only to find most required years of experience I didn't have. It was incredibly frustrating (feeling like my financial goals were slipping through my fingers).</p>
<p>If you're a student in the same boat, I get it. You're juggling classes, assignments, and maybe even extracurricular activities. The last thing you need is a job that's going to eat up all your time. But here's some good news: there are 15 high - paying online jobs that are perfect for students with no experience. Take the example of a student from Moz. This student decided to try content writing. They started by creating a simple portfolio on a free website. In just three months, they landed their first paid gig. By the end of the year, they were making over $1,500 a month, all while managing their studies. </p>
<p>Now, let's talk about how you can implement this for yourself. First, identify your skills and interests. This should take you about an hour. Maybe you're good at writing, like the Moz student, or you're great at graphic design. Once you know what you're good at, research the online jobs that match those skills. Spend about two hours looking at different platforms like Upwork or Fiverr to see what kind of gigs are available. Second, build a basic online presence. This could be a simple LinkedIn profile or a portfolio website. Dedicate a weekend to getting this set up. </p>
<p>With these actionable steps and a bit of perseverance, you can turn your lack of experience into a stepping - stone towards high - paying online jobs. Trust me, it's worth the effort.

<h2>&quot;Common Challenges: How to Solve?&quot;</h2>
<h3>Common Challenges and Solutions</h3>
<p>So, you've probably been in a situation where you're facing roadblocks on your journey to success, just like I did as a student constantly short on cash. One of the most common challenges many students and even young professionals encounter is the struggle to find high - paying online jobs. It can feel like you're in a maze with no clear exit, especially when you lack the right experience or don't know where to look.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a real - world example from the Content Marketing Institute. They found that a young freelancer, Sarah, was struggling to land high - paying online writing gigs. She was spending hours applying to jobs but getting very few responses. After analyzing her situation, she realized her portfolio was lacking and her application emails were generic. So, she took action. She revamped her portfolio, adding her best writing samples, and tailored each application to the specific job requirements. Within three months, her response rate increased by 60%, and she landed three high - paying online contracts. (Imagine the relief and excitement she felt when those first high - paying checks started rolling in!)</p>
<p>Here are some practical solutions you can implement:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Build a Stellar Portfolio (2 - 4 weeks)</strong>: Whether you're into writing, graphic design, or programming, create a portfolio that showcases your best work. Include case studies, testimonials, and any relevant certifications. This will make you stand out from the competition.</li>
<li><strong>Network Actively (ongoing)</strong>: Join online communities related to your field. Participate in discussions, share your knowledge, and connect with potential clients or employers. Platforms like LinkedIn can be a goldmine for high - paying online opportunities.</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps, when followed diligently, can help you overcome the challenges of finding high - paying online jobs, just like Sarah did.</p>

<h2>&quot;Unlock Expert Tips: Best Practices?&quot;</h2>
<p>Now, let's shift gears and talk about some expert tips and best practices that can be a game - changer for students like you. I know how tough it can be to balance school and make some extra cash, just like I faced those struggles as a student myself (the feeling of being so close yet so far from achieving your financial dreams is truly disheartening).</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a real - world example from Ahrefs. A student blogger decided to monetize their study - related blog. In the first three months, they focused on creating high - quality, SEO - optimized content. By the end of the third month, their blog traffic increased by 200%. After implementing affiliate marketing and sponsored posts, they were earning an extra $500 per month within six months. This shows that with the right approach, students can achieve financial goals even while studying.</p>
<p>Here are some practical steps you can take:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Content Creation</strong>: Set aside 2 - 3 hours a week to create well - researched blog posts related to your studies. This could be study guides, subject reviews, or exam tips. In about a month, you'll start to see an increase in organic traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Monetization</strong>: Once your blog has a decent amount of traffic (usually after 3 - 4 months), start looking into affiliate marketing programs relevant to your niche. Spend 1 - 2 hours a week researching and signing up for these programs. You can expect to start earning small amounts within a month of implementing them.</li>
</ol>
<p>These tips are not just theoretical; they're tried and tested ways for students to turn their knowledge and time into a source of income. With a bit of dedication and following these best practices, you can overcome the financial hurdles that come with being a student.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

The 15 high - paying online jobs I've shared are your ticket to breaking free from that financial bind. These gigs don't demand years of experience, so you can start earning right away. </p>
<p>You can balance these jobs with your classes and extracurriculars, turning your spare time into cash. (Imagine finally having the money to pursue your passions without constantly worrying about bills.) </p>
<p>Figuring out how to land these high - paying online jobs might seem daunting at first, but it's worth the effort. Take action now! Pick a job that suits you, polish your skills, and start applying. Don't let a lack of experience hold you back. Your financial freedom is within reach.</p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Can I really get these high - paying online jobs without any prior experience?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can. Many of the 15 high - paying online jobs are designed to be accessible to students with no experience. For example, content writing jobs may only require good language skills, and data entry positions often just need basic computer proficiency. Employers understand that students are at the beginning of their careers and are willing to train the right candidates. Just like I was in a similar situation as a student, you can find opportunities that focus on your potential rather than past experience.</p>
<h3>How much time do I need to commit to these online jobs?</h3>
<p>The time commitment varies depending on the job. Some jobs, like online tutoring, might require a few hours a week to set up sessions and prepare materials. Others, such as virtual customer service, could offer flexible shifts where you can choose to work as little as a few hours a month or more if you have the time. As a student juggling classes, assignments, and extracurriculars, you can pick jobs that fit your schedule.</p>
<h3>Do I need special equipment or software for these jobs?</h3>
<p>It depends on the job. For most data entry or content writing jobs, a basic computer with a reliable internet connection is sufficient. However, if you're interested in graphic design jobs, you'll likely need design software like Adobe Photoshop. Some jobs may also require a headset for communication. You can research each job in the list to understand its specific requirements and see if they are within your reach.</p>]]></content:encoded>
