# On Being Broke in College (And How I Fixed It)

I spent most of freshman year with less than $50 in my bank account.

Not because I was irresponsible. Not because I didn't try. I just couldn't figure out how to make money while also passing my classes.

The jobs available to me all had the same problem: they expected me to show up at specific times. But my class schedule changed every semester. Group projects demanded random evening meetings. Exam weeks wiped out entire weeks of availability.

Something had to give. Usually, it was my grades. Or my sanity.

Then I discovered a different way to think about income.

Instead of finding a "job," I started building income streams. Small, flexible sources of money that I could tap into whenever I had time.

The first was AI evaluation work. Companies building chatbots need humans to review their outputs. Is this response accurate? Helpful? Well-written?

I found platforms that paid $20+ per hour for this kind of thinking work. And critically, I could log in for 15 minutes between classes and actually earn something meaningful.

The second was leveraging my major. I'm studying biology, so I started writing educational content for science blogs. They paid me not as a "writer" but as a subject matter expert. That distinction matters when you're competing for gigs.

> Quick note: Finding these opportunities took me months of research. I eventually built [SideBuz](https://www.sidebuz.com) to help other students skip that process. It matches your skills to async work opportunities. Free, no signup.

The third was selling study materials I was already creating. Notes, cheat sheets, summaries. I packaged them and listed them on Gumroad. Made $50 during finals week with zero extra effort.

None of these are get-rich-quick schemes. But together, they give me enough to cover food, occasional fun, and peace of mind.

The key insight: students don't need "jobs." We need income streams that respect our constraints.

Async work. Text-based communication. No scheduled shifts.

That's the formula.

If you're still trying to fit a traditional job into an impossible schedule, consider a different approach.
