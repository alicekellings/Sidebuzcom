## 帖子 1：推广 "How to Do Homework and Earn Money"

**正文**：
```
💡 Can you really get paid to do homework?

Not in the scammy "write essays for people" way. But in legitimate ways that use your knowledge.

I wrote a complete guide on how students can monetize their study time:

✅ Selling class notes ($100-500/month passive)
✅ Micro-tutoring (help others with ONE problem)
✅ Essay editing (not writing - proofreading)

The platforms I mention are all vetted. No scams.

🎓 25 Business Ideas You Can Start From Your Dorm Room (With $0)

I put together a list of micro-businesses perfect for students:

📱 The "Tech Savvy" Bucket: Notion consulting, website fixing, app testing
🎨 The "Creative" Bucket: Thumbnail design, video editing, slide decks
🏠 The "Campus Life" Bucket: Moving help, laundry service, textbook flipping

The best part? None of these require upfront investment.

Not sure which one fits you? I built a free quiz to help:

## 帖子 3：推广 "Earn Money From Home"

**正文**：
```
The biggest enemy of student income isn't lack of skill.

It's SCHEDULE.

Classes at random times. Exams week. Parties. Life.

You can't commit to a traditional job with shift schedules.

That's why I focus on "Async Work" - income you can earn at 3 AM or 3 PM, on YOUR terms.

Here are the 3 best async income streams I've found:
1️⃣ AI Training Platforms ($20+/hr)
2️⃣ Niche Content Writing ($100+ per article)
3️⃣ Digital Products (passive income)

Full breakdown with platforms and tips:
