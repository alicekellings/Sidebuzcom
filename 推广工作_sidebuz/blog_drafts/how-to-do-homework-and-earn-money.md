# How to Do Homework and Earn Money (Legitimately)

Let's be real. You are already doing homework. You are already taking notes. You are already solving math problems.

Why aren't you getting paid for it?

The phrase "get paid to do homework" sounds like a scam. Usually, it is. If you Google it, you'll find bots asking you to fill out surveys for $0.50 an hour.

But there is a legitimate "Knowledge Economy" where your brainpower is worth actual cash. I'm talking about $15-$50 an hour.

As a student, you have one asset that adults don't have: **Academic currency**.

Here is how to trade that currency for cash in 2025.

## Method 1: The "Note Flipper" Strategy (Passive)

**Best for**: Organized students who take color-coded notes.
**Potential Income**: $100-$500/month.

You take notes anyway. Why let them sit in your notebook? Platforms like [Studypool](https://www.studypool.com) and [Nexus Notes](https://nexusnotes.com) allow you to upload your class notes.

When another student downloads them, you get paid.

**The Strategy:**
1.  **Digitize**: Don't just upload photos. Type them out.
2.  **SEO Your Notes**: Title them clearly. "BIO 101: Cell Division Summaries (Professor Smith's Class)".
3.  **Upload**: Put them on multiple marketplaces.

*Success Tip*: "Cheat Sheets" sell better than full notes. Create a 1-page summary of an entire semester. That is gold.

## Method 2: The "Micro-Tutor" (Active)

**Best for**: STEM majors (Math, Physics, Comp Sci).
**Potential Income**: $20-$40/hour.

You don't need to be a certified teacher. Platforms like [Chegg Tutors](https://www.chegg.com/tutors) and [Course Hero](https://www.coursehero.com) connect you with students who are stuck on *one specific problem*.

You aren't teaching a whole class. You are just showing them how to solve `Integrals of x^2`.

**Why this works**:
*   No commitment (log in whenever).
*   High demand at 2 AM (when everyone is panicking).
*   Instant pay.

## Method 3: The "Essay Editor" (Not Writer)

**Best for**: English/Humanities majors.
**Potential Income**: $0.05 - $0.10 per word.

**Warning**: Do not write essays for people. That is plagiarism and can get you expelled.
**Do**: Edit and proofread.

Use [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com) or [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com). List your service as "Academic Proofreading & Formatting (APA/MLA)".

International students often struggle with grammar. They will happily pay you $20 to fix their syntax before they submit.

## Tools You Need

You don't need much, but you do need to be organized.

1.  **Scanner App**: To digitize handwritten diagrams.
2.  **Paypal/Wise**: To get paid.
3.  **Sidebuz**: Use our [Student Income Finder](/tools/student-income-finder/) to see which of these platforms matches your specific major.

## Final Warning: The Scams

If a site asks you to pay a "registration fee", run.
If a site asks you to move the conversation to Telegram, run.

Stick to the big platforms: Chegg, Course Hero, Studypool, Skooli.

You are already doing the work. You might as well get paid for it.
